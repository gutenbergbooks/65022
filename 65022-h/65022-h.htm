  <h2 class='c005'>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Since the Publication of the early editions
of this Essay, the Author has witnessed with
very great satisfaction the amendment of a
large proportion of the Turnpike Roads, and
some improvement of the Parish Roads. That
the reformation has not been more extensive
and successful, may be attributed to the error
still persisted in by Trustees, of continuing the
services of persons as Road Surveyors, who are
not only altogether ignorant of the business they
profess, but full of prejudices in favour of their
own erroneous practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another and a greater error has been committed
lately, in several parts of the Country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ii'>ii</span>and which has entirely arisen from the desire
entertained of using the new method of Road
making. This very dangerous error consists in
employing persons who offer themselves as having
been instructed in Road making on scientific
principles, without due inquiry respecting their
skill, industry, and moral character.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the many persons who present themselves
to be instructed, a very small proportion
acquire a competent knowledge of their profession,
and this number is farther diminished by
subsequent dismission for negligence, drunkenness,
and dishonesty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of these rejected and incapable persons, great
numbers are spread over the Country, soliciting
employment; and many have been incautiously
engaged by Trustees, without inquiry either as
to their character or their ability in their profession.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the most favourable circumstances for
the constant and vigilant control of a master,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iii'>iii</span>whose public credit depends on the economical
and skilful performance of the work, it is difficult
to keep sub-surveyors in the strict line of
their duty; but it may be easily conceived how
much the public must suffer from accepting the
services of men rejected for gross misconduct,
and placing them in situations of confidence,
altogether freed from the only control capable
of being exerted with effect. This error, although
of recent date, has already been attended
with very disastrous consequences in several
places.</p>

<p class='c007'>A practical experience of Six Years, has
served to confirm the opinion of the Author,
that the control of Commissioners over surveyors
is altogether ineffectual; whether for direction
in their active duties, or for protecting the funds
of Trusts from waste and peculation. The unceasing
control, and minute inspection of a person
whom the surveyors know to be as much
their superior in skill and general information,
as in station in society, and in the confidence of
the Commissioners, is absolutely necessary for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>the protection of the Roads. Where such control
is duly exercised, good management with
economy will be the result; and wherever a
mistaken notion of economy shall continue to
prevent the application of such wholesome and
necessary control, the roads will be imperfectly
repaired, and the funds dissipated.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears from the returns made to Parliament,
that the sum annually raised for the use
of the Roads exceeds the neat revenue of the
Post Office; yet is this very large sum expended
through the hands of persons of the lowest rank
in society, under an appearance of control;
which equally deceives the public and deludes
the expectation of those who conduct the general
business of the Roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Commissioners can only act with effect, as a
deliberative body; and their most beneficial resolutions
are rendered valueless, through want
of a steady executive power. Any attempt on
the part of <i>individual</i> Commissioners to exercise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>this power is a still more dangerous course.
The designs of the majority may thus be impeded,
or thwarted by the subsequent interference
of a single person.</p>

<p class='c007'>All other branches of the public revenue are
defended by the station and character of the
persons, under whose care they are placed.
The Legislature and the Government have wisely
considered it important (with a view to economy)
to purchase talents, and station, as a protection for
every branch of the public expenditure; but in the
case of the Roads they have miscalculated the
power and effect of the controlling and directing
authority. A proper comparison has not been
made of the duties, or of the effect of the exertions
of a body composed of unpaid and unresponsible
individuals, like the road Commissioners, and those
of bodies composed of Boards of Commissioners,
in the pay, and responsible to the Government
for the due administration of the trust reposed in
them: having also proper officers equally responsible
as themselves to act under their directions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>The state of the public roads, the alarming amount
of an increasing debt, the loose and neglected
state of the accounts of the several Trusts, are
the best proofs of the defects of the system, and
of its comparative inefficiency.</p>

<p class='c007'>The returns made to Parliament by the several
Trusts in the kingdom (defective as they are)
afford matter for serious reflection. England
alone, is divided into 955 little Trusts which
may be considered, in fact, as hostile to each
other; while it is evident that unity of action is
of vital importance among Commissioners of
the same branch of the public service, for effecting
the great object of their appointment.
While therefore each of those small communities
is liable to be biassed by individual interest
or feeling, it will hardly be deemed inexpedient
to recommend some central control over the
District Commissioners, that may have the
effect of regulating the eccentricity of their
measures, as well as giving their views, in many
instances, a better direction. This central control
will be most beneficially established in each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>county, under such regulations, and with such
powers as the wisdom of Parliament may deem
most effectual.</p>

<p class='c007'>A General Road Act must, in order to adapt
itself to the exigences of the times, embrace a
comprehensive view of the subject: and effectually
remedy all the great evils which have
originated in the weakness of the system, and
have been allowed to grow up, through a want
of attention to the altered state of the commerce,
agriculture, manufactures, and general interests
of the kingdom. Until the Legislature shall
be pleased to enter into a serious consideration
of the subject, no general and useful amendment
can take place. The great debt, (exceeding at
this moment Seven Millions,) will continue to
increase, and improvement will still be impeded
by obstacles not removeable by any other power
except the authority of Parliament.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE<br /> <span class='small'>TO THE</span><br /> <span class='large'>SEVENTH EDITION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In preparing another edition of the various
papers on roads, which I have published during
the last six years, it may be useful to take a
slight review of the subject, and of the gradual
progress of road improvement throughout the
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>That any further information should be
called for, after the numerous additions made
to the original pamphlet, (particularly the last
communication to the Board of Agriculture,) is
a convincing proof of the impossibility of conveying
adequate instructions for practical purposes,
by means of the press. It is, however,
of the utmost importance that the <i>theory</i> be
fully understood, as from want of comprehending
the original nature of the system have arisen
the many fruitless attempts at imitation, which
have cost such vast sums to the public.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>The practical utility of some parts of the
system is so obvious, that they have been acted
upon in various places, without any desire of
further improvement. It is uncommon now, to
meet with roads repaired with large stones, or
of the dangerous convex form, which was the
universal custom about five years ago; but these
improvements being merely grafted on the old
erroneous method, have never been attended
with the rapid diminution of expense, and the
durable advantages which immediately result
from the adoption of the entire system as recommended
by me.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who continue to use any part of the
old method of road-making, are not, perhaps,
aware of the principles upon which they are
acting. I have formerly remarked, that the
old roads of the country were generally carried
along the tops of hills in search of dry or strong
ground; and it is plain that the first turnpike
roads were merely attempts to open more direct
communications through the country, in continuing,
by mechanical means, the rocky paths,
to which travellers were obliged to resort.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>With this view, large masses of stone were first
sunk into the ground, and afterwards thick
layers of broken stone strewed over them, so as,
in fact, to form an artificial rock. The insecurity
of this unskilful structure must be obvious.
The rain penetrating through every part of the
surface kept it continually in a loose state, and
as it was imbedded <i>below</i> the <i>ground</i> water, it
was constantly broken up in winter by the frost.
Hence the vast sums required for the forming
new roads, and the heavy and incessant expense
of keeping them in a passable state. Any improvements
that have been made on this plan,
merely relate to the smoothness of the surface,
by more carefully laying on the stones, at, consequently,
a greater expense: but the original
principle remains the same in every road, except
those where the new system has been fully
adopted. Under such disadvantages, it is not
surprizing that the roads of the kingdom have
not kept pace with the advancement of every
other useful art. The large sums demanded for
the first outlay, and the frequent failure of such
speculations from the badness of the roads, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>the expense of their subsequent repairs, sufficiently
account for the tardy progress of road-making.
From conviction of the very insufficient
and expensive nature of the method in use,
I was led to consider of the possibility of constructing
lines of communication, capable of
conveying the heaviest weights over every kind
of soil, and at all seasons, upon principles purely
scientific: a plan, which even in theory differs
as widely from the inartificial methods of road-making
hitherto practised, as the principle by
which an arch is thrown over a river, differs
from the heap of stones which constitutes the
ford.</p>

<p class='c007'>The actual experience of seven years, the
great extent of road which has been entirely
constructed according to my direction, and the
unquestionable testimony of the Committees of
the House of Commons appointed to enquire
into this matter, have now placed the efficiency
of the discovery beyond a doubt. It remains
with the country to consider of the most wise
and effectual mode of securing the benefit of
the system.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>Whoever has attentively considered the weakness
and inadequacy of the present road laws,
to protect the great interest at stake, must be
aware of the urgent necessity for some new
legislative measures, more adapted to the present
state of the country. The roads are, perhaps,
the most important branch of our domestic
economy. The revenue collected for their support
equals that of the Post-office; and any
failure in executing the work, operates as a
severe check upon our commerce, manufactures,
and agriculture. Yet a public service of such
vital importance, continues to be regulated
solely by the narrow policy and limited views
of the first Turnpike Act, (which were, in fact,
mere experiments in legislation,) while this immense
revenue is abandoned to the discretion or
the cupidity of the lower orders of society.</p>

<p class='c007'>The benefit which I have aspired to render
the country, is of a twofold nature; and my
labours have been as constantly directed towards
the introduction of a wise and well-regulated
system of management for the roads, as
towards their mechanical construction. I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>always expressed a conviction, that no permanent
improvement could take place in road affairs,
without the interference of the legislature; nor
has the success attending the efforts of my family,
in various places, in any way tended to
weaken that opinion. The advantages of the
new method of making roads are so apparent,
they have not failed of attracting attention; but
I have not been equally fortunate in inducing
the gentlemen of the country to observe the
<i>means</i> by which <i>economy</i> and improvement have
been combined.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not only to the simplicity and cheapness
of the new system, that the great difference of
expense is owing. In every place where the
system has been properly acted upon, care has
been taken to place the road business on the
same respectable footing as other branches of
the public service; a complete executive department
has been created. The inferior officers,
selected from the most respectable yeomanry,
are placed under the vigilant inspection of a superior,
whose responsibility secures his attention,
and who is not liable to be biassed by any influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>in the duties of his office. The great success
that has attended the adoption of this plan,
under all the disadvantages of the present road
laws, is an earnest of what might result from its
being established on a comprehensive scale,
under the authority of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although no measures have yet been taken for
establishing any systematic plan for the management
of roads, it is gratifying to observe the
spirit of improvement which is extending itself
over the country. This is manifest in various
ways. The plan of converting the pavements
of streets into stoned roads, was introduced into
the Bristol district about six years ago; and it
may reasonably be expected, that pavements
will very soon be nearly superseded by the more
convenient, safe, and economical substitute of
stoned roads. Of the superior convenience of
roads, there can be no question; and all the
minor objections which have been started can
be so easily obviated, that a very little reflection
will be sufficient for any candid mind. The inhabitants
of towns are generally apprehensive
that roads will be less commodious for foot passengers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>than pavements: but (if proper care be
bestowed on cleaning and watering) a road
made of broken stone will be found more eligible
than such pavements as those of London. In
some towns, where the principal streets are
turnpike roads, the commissioners have caused
them to be made of materials broken very small,
which, when skilfully laid, form a smooth, firm
surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great difference between the cost of a
road, and even the worst London pavement,
would enable the city to bestow such care on the
cleanliness of the carriage ways, as would allow
the inhabitants to enjoy all the advantages of
smooth road, with even increased comfort to the
foot passenger.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The present very defective state of the Turnpike
Roads and Highways in the United Kingdom,
and the continual and apparently unlimited
increase of the Toll Duties, are the considerations,
which have given rise to the publication
of the following remarks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the value of the information contained in
them, the intelligent reader will be the most
competent judge; the author can only venture
to assure him, that the few facts brought forward
in the course of the work have been most
carefully authenticated; that the opinions advanced
are the result of much thought, and
patient investigation; that whatever may appear
theoretical, has, for the most part, been
already reduced to practice; and that where
practice has been wanting, a long experience of
the evils arising from the present system, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>not the mere love of innovation, has been the
motive for the suggestion of the remedies proposed.</p>

<p class='c007'>These, however, the author gladly submits
to the good sense and candour of the public; only
requesting, in the words of a celebrated writer,
that whoever favors him with a perusal, will
not judge by a few hours reading of the labours
of nearly thirty years.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the following chapters, the subject of
Roads will be considered under three principal
heads:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The mode of making Roads</span>;</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Commissioners, and Officers employed
under them, for this service</span>,</p>
<p class='c008'>and</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The care of the Finances</span>:</p>

<p class='c007'>Which has appeared to the Author the most
clear and comprehensive arrangement.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>REMARKS ON ROADS.</i></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>PART FIRST.<br /> <i>THE MODE OF MAKING ROADS.</i></h3>

<p class='c006'>The modes of making and repairing Roads
are so various in the different parts of the kingdom,
that it would be an endless task to attempt
a particular account of each. It may, however,
be possible to give a general idea of them, according
to the materials produced in each part
of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the neighbourhood of London, the roads
are formed of gravel; in Essex and Sussex, they
are formed of flint; in Wilts, Somerset, and
Glocester, limestone is principally used; in the
North of England, and in Scotland, whinstone
is the principal material; and in Shropshire
and Staffordshire, large pebbles mixed with
sand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Excellent roads may be made with any of
these materials.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The gravel of which the roads round London
are formed is the worst; because it is mixed
with a large portion of clay, and because the
component parts of gravel are round, and want
the angular points of contact, by which broken
stone unites, and forms a solid body; the loose
state of the roads near London, is a consequence
of this quality in the material, and of
the entire neglect, or ignorance of the method
of amending it.</p>

<p class='c007'>A more careful examination of facts connected
with the roads round London, has discovered
several other causes, from whence proceeds
the defective state of these roads. The greatest
appears to be, the division of the roads into so
many small Trusts, which precludes the possibility
of any extended plan of operations, for
the benefit of the whole. Before any one road
round London can be properly reformed, and all
wasteful expenditure restrained, a comprehensive
view of the local situation of the whole
district will be requisite.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another great impediment to improvement,
arises from the laws and regulations, which
prevent a supply of good road materials, of
several kinds, being brought to London by
water, and landed in different places, convenient
for the roads. Were these restrictions removed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>as far as concerns stone, flint, or any
ballast for road-making, London is so favorably
situated for water carriage by the river, and by
the canals connected with it, that a supply,
equal to the wants of all the roads in the vicinity
of London, might be obtained at a reasonable
rate, and of good quality, so as to render
the use of the bad gravel round the metropolis
no longer necessary.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> But this measure,
to be performed in an economical, and
efficient manner, must be done upon an extended
scale; it must become one interest, directed
by one select body of men of weight,
ability, and character.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. This must not be understood as conveying an opinion, that a good
road may not be constructed with the London gravel, properly prepared
and applied. The road at Reading, in Berkshire, has lately been made
perfectly smooth, solid, and level, with a gravel inferior to that of London,
and at less than it formerly cost. Carriages make no impression on this
road, and it has remained good in all changes of weather. Nevertheless, a
means having been discovered, by diligent enquiry, for importing flints,
from a distance, the Reading road will, in future, be repaired with flint,
at half the expence required to prepare the gravel of the neighbourhood.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A road near London may be made as smooth,
solid, and easy for cattle to draw carriages over,
as the road near Bristol; and the London road
<i>so made</i> will last longer, and consequently be
less expensive than the Bristol road, because
the materials which may be obtained are more
durable, and may be procured at less expence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Flint makes an excellent road, if due attention
be paid to the size; but from want of that
attention, many of the flint roads are rough,
loose, and expensive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Limestone, when properly prepared and applied,
makes a smooth, solid road, and becomes
consolidated sooner than any other material;
but from its nature is not the most lasting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whinstone is the most durable of all materials;
and wherever it is well and judiciously
applied, the roads are comparatively good and
cheap.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pebbles of Shropshire and Staffordshire,
are of a hard substance, and only require a
prudent application to be made good road materials.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, the Scottish roads, made of
the very best materials, which are abundant and
cheap in every part of that country, are the
most loose, rough, and expensive roads in the
United Kingdom, owing to the unskilful use of
the material.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>formation</i> of roads is defective in most
parts of the country; in particular the roads
round London, are made high in the middle, in
the form of a roof, by which means a carriage
goes upon a dangerous slope, unless kept on the
very centre of the road.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>These roads are repaired by throwing a large
quantity of unprepared gravel in the middle,
and trusting that, by its never consolidating, it
will in due time move towards the sides.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a road has been originally well made,
it will be easily repaired. Such a road can
never become rough, or loose; though it will
gradually wear thin and weak, in proportion to
the use to which it is exposed; the amendment
will then be made, by the addition of a quantity
of materials prepared as at first. As there will
be no expense on such road, between the first
making and each subsequent repair, except the
necessary attention to the water-ways, and to
accidental injuries, the funds will be no longer
burdened with the unceasing expenditure, at
present experienced, from continual efforts at
repairing, without amendment of the roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>There cannot be a doubt, that all the roads
in the kingdom may be made smooth and solid,
in an equal degree, and to continue so at all
seasons of the year. Their durability will of
course depend on the strength of the materials
of which they may be composed, but they will
all be good while they last, and the only question
that can arise respecting the kind of materials,
is one of time and expence, but never of
the immediate condition of the roads.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The anxious provisions of the Legislature for
<i>preservation</i> of the roads have unfortunately
taken precedence of measures for making roads
fit to be travelled upon, or worth the care of
being preserved. Will it be deemed presumptuous
to propose, that some regulations may be
adopted, for encouraging and promoting a better
system of making roads, by eliciting the
exertion of science, and by creating a set of officers
of skill, and reputation, to superintend this
most essential branch of domestic economy?</p>

<p class='c007'>When roads are properly made, very few regulations
are necessary for their preservation.
It is certainly useful to make effectual provision
for keeping clear the watercourses, for
removing nuisances, and for the pruning of trees
and hedges; for these purposes ample powers
should be given to Commissioners; but the
advantage of many existing regulations respecting
wheeled carriages may very well be questioned.
There can be no doubt that many of
those regulations are oppressive to commerce
and agriculture, by compelling an inconvenient
construction of carriages.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> The author has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>never observed any great difference of effect, on
a <i>well made road</i>, by narrow or broad wheels;
either of them will pass over a smooth, solid
road, without leaving any visible impression:
on rough, loose roads, the effect will certainly
be different; but whether a loose and rough
road can be amended by dragging an unwieldy
carriage over it, or whether, if it were possible
to amend roads by such means, it can be deemed
the most economical for the nation at large, can
hardly be subject of doubt.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. The increase of the breadth of the wheels, though in a greater proportion
than that of the weights, is by no means a compensation for it; because
the whole breadth in many instances, from the inequality of the
ground, or the wheels, will not be brought to bear whenever it can, the
first impression must be made by the nails, where they are prominent,
perhaps by a single nail; or the bearing may happen upon single pieces
of materials, or upon the edges of materials, incapable of supporting the
weights. <i>See Enquiry into the State of the Public Roads, by the Rev.</i>
<span class='sc'>Henry Homer</span>, <i>A. M. Rector of Birdlingbury, Warwickshire. Published in
1767, Page 66.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>It must be observed, that these remarks of Mr. Homer, and of every
other writer on the subject of roads, are only applicable to such as are
loose, rough, and uneven; and that no one seems to have contemplated
the idea of a road being made at once strong, smooth, and solid.—<span class='sc'>Author.</span></p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Broad-wheeled carriages are found to be so unadapted to the purposes
of husbandry, the number of horses requisite for their draught so great,
and the beneficial effects of them to the road so questionable, that neither
the encouragements on the one hand, nor the discouragements on the
other, have been sufficient to bring them into general use.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>It must however be admitted, that the wear
of roads is proportioned to the weight and velocity
of carriages running upon a given breadth
of the tire of the wheels, and therefore, it is of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>consequence that some regulations should be
adopted. The best regulations, as regard the
breadth of the tire of wheels, will be found in
several Acts of the Session of Parliament 1816,
where Carts are required to have wheels of a
cylindrical form five inches broad; and Waggon
Wheels of the same form six inches broad,
with an equal upright bearing. The weights
will be best and most easily regulated by the
number of horses, or other cattle, drawing the
carriages: and this, as a regulation of economy,
may be made, by the tolls at present payable
on the cattle being levied in a larger ratio as
the number increases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Waggons and carts with wheels of a cylindrical
form and upright bearing, running on a
breadth of tire of five and six inches, cannot
injure a well made road, at the slow pace with
which such carriages travel; at least, in any
proportion beyond the toll they pay. On the
contrary, it is certain, that Stage Coaches, with
their present system of loading, and velocity of
travelling upon very narrow wheels, damage
the roads in a much greater proportion than
the compensation derived from the toll.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every wheel, propelled by a force applied to
its centre of motion, as the axis of a carriage
wheel, is disposed by its specific gravity, to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>dragged forwards, instead of turning round;
and the rotative motion is occasioned by the
resistance presented by the surface over which
it passes; yet this resistance does not entirely
prevent dragging; for every wheel running upon
a road drags in some degree. This degree will
be proportioned to the weight of the carriage,
and the velocity of the wheel upon its axis, and
will be opposed by the breadth of the tire
coming in contact with the road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stage Coaches, therefore, carrying heavy
weights, moving with great velocity, and presenting
to the road a narrow tire of wheel,
must of necessity drag in a greater degree
than any other carriage, as combining in themselves
every cause by which dragging is produced.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. Above fifty Stage Coach journies are made daily between <span class='sc'>Bristol</span>
and <span class='sc'>Bath</span>: the Author’s observation leads him to the conclusion, that
the toll-duty paid by them, does not indemnify the funds for the wearing
of the road.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When the Legislature shall have provided
the means of putting all the roads in the United
Kingdom into the best and fittest state for the
accommodation of the agriculture and commerce
of the country, they will naturally consider
of the most proper modes of protecting
them from injury, or for indemnifying the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>funds for the effects of use which are unavoidable,
by imposing toll duties in a just and
equitable proportion on the carriages occasioning
such injury.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
  <h3 class='c003'>PART SECOND.<br /> <i>COMMISSIONERS AND OFFICERS EMPLOYED UNDER THEM.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The care of the Turnpike Roads has been
committed by Parliament, into the hands of
Commissioners, selected from that class of society,
most capable of executing the duties of
superintendance, and from their station most
likely to perform the duty with fidelity; in
this respect the expectations of the public has
not been disappointed; and there can be but
one opinion, upon the obligations the country
owes to this very respectable part of the community.
Perhaps the only useful regulation
wanted, in respect to Commissioners, would be
to confine the qualification of Trustees to <i>landed</i>
property.</p>

<p class='c007'>The superintending and controuling power,
so wisely placed by Parliament in the Commissioners,
has not, however, been sufficient to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>secure all the objects of the Legislature. A
scientific, laborious, executive power is wanting;
and no means having been thought of for
this part of the service, it has been altogether
neglected, or at best very unprofitably supplied
by a set of Surveyors, altogether ignorant
of the duties of the office they were called upon
to fill.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. The general laws relating to highways seem sufficiently calculated
to answer the purpose intended by them, if Overseers were qualified with
a sufficient degree of judgment to execute them properly, and of industry
and spirit to do it effectually.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>General superintendance and gratuitous services,
such as the law contemplated to receive
from the Commissioners of Turnpikes, may be
obtained, and have been faithfully and conscientiously
given by the Commissioners; but
that constant and laborious attention, requisite
to superintend the executive duties of a turnpike
trust, cannot reasonably be expected from
gentlemen engaged in other pursuits. Were
they to undertake the task, it must be subject
to all the interruptions of their private affairs, or
other occupations; and this alone would render
their services nugatory. Some instances of
individual zeal and exertion, on the part of
Commissioners, in particular parts of the country,
have served to show what benefit might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>derived from providing each county with an
executive officer, whose sole attention should be
given to the business; whose services should
be amply remunerated, and of whom the Commissioners
might <i>of right</i> demand an account
of the manner in which their orders were carried
into execution; who should examine and
audit the accounts of the Sub-surveyors; compare
them with the work performed, and certify
them, if approved, to the Treasurers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a trust of any extent, say about 150 miles
of road, the time of such an officer would be
very fully employed. He must direct the execution
of the repairs, and alterations of the road,
when ordered by the Commissioners; and he
must controul the contracts, and other agreements
entered into by the Sub-surveyors, so as
to prevent unnecessary expence; he must examine
all work performed, to see that it is corresponding
with contracts, and generally keep
a vigilant superintendance over the persons employed
under him. Accounts of all expences
incurred should every second week be delivered
by the Sub-surveyors into his office in
duplicate; after examination, one copy to remain
in the office, the other certified, to be sent
to the Treasurer, upon which payment may
follow.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Much must depend on the selection of the
officer to whom this charge is committed; he
must have a considerable share of general information
respecting country business; the subject
of road-making ought to have been well
considered by him; his station in society should
be such, as to secure to him the support and
confidence of the Commissioners, while it commands
the obedience and deference of the subordinate
officers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The success of the exertions of individual
Commissioners, in particular parts of the country
first suggested the opinion, that a better
system of road-making might be adopted, and
the examples of a better practice extended to
all parts of the country; but the benefit can
never be rendered thus general, unless accompanied
by the zeal and activity that produced
it; and this can only be supplied by officers,
whose sole duty it shall be, and who will be
accountable to the Commissioners under whose
orders they act for the execution of the trust
confided to them. Gratuitous services are ever
temporary and local, they are dependant on
the residence, and life of the party; and have
always disappointed expectation. Skill and
executive labour must be adequately paid for,
if expected to be constantly and usefully exerted;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and if so exerted, the price is no consideration
when compared with the advantage
to the public.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the want of such an officer, the orders
of the Commissioners, after having been maturely
considered, and wisely given, have fallen,
for execution into the hands of Surveyors, selected
not unfrequently from the lowest class
of the community, who have proceeded without
plan or method. The consequence is seen in
every corner of the country; want of science
in the Surveyor has gone hand in hand with
improvident expenditure, to the injury of the
roads, and the derangement of the finances. A
vigilant and unremitting superintendance is
wanting to ensure an economical and effectual
execution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether it may not be useful to empower
Commissioners in the small Trusts into which
the roads of England are unfortunately divided,
to unite together in sufficient number to enable
them to provide a respectable and efficient executive
officer, and for other general purposes of
improvement, is humbly submitted to the wisdom
of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect of an active and efficient controul
over the Sub-surveyors, in the executive part of
their duties; and in rescuing the funds from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>mis-application and depredation, is exemplified
in the measures wisely entered into by the Commissioners
for the care of the turnpike roads in
the <span class='sc'>Bristol District</span>, the success of which
has amply justified their adoption, the roads
having been entirely reformed and put into the
best possible state for use, at an expence considerably
within the revenue of the Trust. This
improved state of the finances has enabled the
Commissioners to effect several great permanent
improvements, without forgetting the necessary
provision for liquidation of the debt, which had
accumulated during former years.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h3 class='c003'>PART THIRD.<br /> <span class='large'><i>CARE OF THE FINANCES.</i></span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The funds placed by the Legislature at the
disposal of the Commissioners for the care of
turnpike roads are very considerable, and might
be supposed with proper management, fully
equal to the object; they arise principally
from toll duties, and a proportion of statute
labour.</p>

<p class='c007'>As long as it shall be necessary to raise large
sums for the maintenance of roads, the present
means must continue; toll duties, although liable
to many objections, are so <i>immediately</i>,
and <i>effectually</i> productive, that little hope can
be entertained of the possibility of their being
reduced, until a continuance of a better system
shall have materially amended the roads, and
reduced the expence, so as to leave means for
extinguishing the heavy debt owing by the
country for this branch of the public service.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Statute labour, in kind, was decreed by Parliament
at a time, when no better means could
be devised: when a circulating medium was
deficient, and when a fair quantum of labour
could not, in many parts of the country, be obtained
for money.</p>

<p class='c007'>Personal labour for a public service can never
be made profitable, or fairly productive; at the
same time, it is liable to the great objections of
being made an instrument of partiality and oppression
under the direction of a class of men
with whom such a power should never be lodged,
and over whom, in this instance, no adequate
controul can be placed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The causes, which operated to induce Parliament
to resort to personal service, having
ceased, it will be found expedient to commute
statute labour for a moderate assessment in
money. This has been effected with great advantage
in Scotland, by most, if not all of the
local and county Acts for turnpike roads.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. It is impossible not to see that statute labour is a remnant of personal
service; a gentleman might as well argue at the present day, that rents
paid in kind, are more easy and equitable than monied rents, as to defend
the custom of mending highways by compulsory labour.</p>

      <div class='line in6'><span class='sc'>Roads and Carriages</span>, p. 46.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The sum of money annually raised in the
kingdom for roads is very great, and would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>be found, if carefully examined into, much
beyond the general belief. Government have
procured information, as to the sum raised annually
for <i>parish</i> roads (generally denominated
highways) but they have not yet enquired into
the amount of the much greater sum raised for
the maintenance of the <i>turnpike</i> roads, nor into
the amount of the debt incurred for the same
purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>These funds, considerable as they are, continue
to be expended, <i>nominally</i>, under the
direction of Commissioners, but <i>effectually</i> and
<i>practically</i> under the Surveyors, over whom the
Commissioners have very uncertain means of
useful controul; and there is no doubt, that
much abuse exists in the expenditure, partly
from ignorance, but much more from peculation
and patronage very much misplaced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under such circumstances the protection of
the funds would be promoted by the inspection
and controul of a superior officer; and finally it
might be desirable, that a report from each trust
should be made to Parliament of the receipt and
expenditure for the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the funds provided by Parliament for
the roads are either insufficient for the object, or
that they are improvidently expended, is
best proved by the numerous applications to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Parliament in every Session, for extension of
powers and increase of tolls; setting forth that
without such aid the debts cannot be paid, nor
the roads kept in repair. In the Session of Parliament
1815, thirty-four such petitions were
presented; and in the Session of 1816, thirty-two;
all which bills were passed <i>as a matter of
course</i>; the petitioners being only required to
prove the <i>actual necessity</i> to the Committee, but
no enquiry seems to have been made as to the
<i>cause</i> of that necessity.</p>

<p class='c007'>An efficient, uniform and constant controul
of the expenditure of road funds, and an annual
report of the result to Parliament would
enable the House of Commons to form a judgment,
whether the deficiency proceeded from
inadequacy of the means, or from improvident
expenditure; and thereby that Honourable
House would be enabled to use means for preventing
the growing amount of debt, which
the petitions presented each Sessions sufficiently
shew to be increasing to an alarming degree;
and which, being incurred under the authority
of Parliament, must ultimately become a claim
upon the justice of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon consideration of this important subject
it appears, that a review of the turnpike laws
has become indispensable, for the purpose of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>altering and amending obsolete, useless, and
oppressive regulations; and for substituting
others more consonant with the present state
of society. This review is required by experience
of the inadequacy of the present system,
to the great object of forming the best and
easiest communications through every part of
the country, with a due regard to economy;
and for preventing the increase of a debt, which
has been allowed, <i>in silence</i>, to accumulate to an
extent, that will hardly be credited when properly
and accurately ascertained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many and important improvements have
originated from the good sense and zeal of individual
Commissioners, or from particular
district meetings, the good effects of which
have been confined to the place of origin; such
improvements have also ceased to operate, on
the death or removal of their authors, and have
been thereby finally lost, for want of a general
superintendance, which would have an interest
in the improvement of the whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defective state of the roads, independent
of the unnecessary expence, is oppressive on
agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, by
the increase of the price of transport, by waste
of the labour of cattle, and wear of carriages,
as well as by causing much delay of time.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Under an efficient and responsible executive
department, established and directed by the
wisdom of Parliament, this subject would be
brought within the means of examination and regulation;
and many local improvements, which
have been confined to small districts, would be
brought forward, and communicated generally
for the public benefit.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

sooner or later the good sense of the English nation will feel the necessity
of adopting some means of improvement.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Ireland, the cross roads are generally better than the great roads,
and comparing all the roads in that country with the roads in England,
the shameful inferiority of the latter would evidently appear.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>The Author has abstained from any notice
of the parish roads; although their condition
and the state of their funds, are more deplorable
than that of the turnpike roads. The Legislative
enactments for their maintenance and repair
are so inadequate to the object, that they
may be considered as being placed almost out
of the protection of the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>There can be no apparent good reason, why,
such a distinction should be made between the
two description of roads; and their being both
placed under the care of the Commissioners,
with the benefit of the scientific direction of a
General Surveyor, would ensure an equal improvement
of the parish roads.</p>

  <h4 class='c011'><i>The foregoing Remarks on Roads cannot be better concluded than by the following Extract from the Report of the Committee of the House of Commons in 1811.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“The many important advantages to be derived
from amending the highways and turnpike
roads of the kingdom need hardly be dwelt
upon. Every individual in it would thereby
find his comforts materially increased, and his
interest greatly promoted. By the improvement
of our roads, every branch of our agricultural,
commercial, and manufacturing industry
would be materially benefited. Every article
brought to market would be diminished in
price; the number of horses would be so much
reduced, that by these, and other retrenchments,
the expence of FIVE MILLIONS
would be annually saved to the public. The
expence of repairing roads, and the wear and
tear of carriages and horses, would be essentially
diminished; and thousands of acres, the
produce of which is now wasted in feeding
unnecessary horses, would be devoted to the
production of food for man. In short, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>public and private advantages, which would
result from effecting that great object, the improvement
of our highways and turnpike roads,
are incalculable; though from their being spread
over a wide surface, and available in various
ways, such advantages will not be so apparent
as those derived from other sources of improvement,
of a more restricted and less general
nature.”</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c009'><i>Extracts from Observations on the Highways of the Kingdom, by</i> <span class='sc'>John Loudon MᶜAdam</span>, <i>presented to a Committee of the House of Commons, and printed by order of the House, 14th June 1811</i>.</h3>

<p class='c006'>“In all the Reports of Committees of the
House of Commons on the subject of Roads,
they seem to have had principally in view the
construction of wheeled carriages, the weights
they were to draw, and the breadth and form
of their wheels; the nature of the roads on
which these carriages were to travel has not
been so well attended to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The observations I have made in a period
of twenty-six years on the roads of the kingdom,
in which time I have travelled over the
greater number in England and Scotland, and
the opportunities I have had of making comparisons
on the different materials and the
modes of their application, have led me to
form the following conclusions.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“1st. That the present bad condition of the
roads of the kingdom is owing to the injudicious
application of the materials with which
they are repaired, and to the defective form of
the roads.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“2nd. That the introduction of a better system
of making the <i>surface</i> of roads, and the
application of scientific principles, which has
hitherto never been thought of, would remedy
the evil.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In illustration of these positions, I beg to
observe, that the object to be attained in a
good road, as far as regards the surface, is to
have it smooth, solid, and so flat as that a carriage
may stand upright; these objects are
not attained by the present system, because
no scientific principles are applied; but it is
presumed they are perfectly attainable in all
parts of the country.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stone is to be procured in some form in almost
every part of the kingdom, and a road
made of small broken stone to the depth of
ten inches, will be smooth, solid and durable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The materials of which the present roads
are composed, are not worn out; but are displaced
by the action of the wheels of carriages
upon stones of too large a size: the
wheel does not <i>pass over</i> the materials of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>which the road is formed, but is constantly,
almost at every step, encountering an obstacle
which must either give way and be removed,
or the carriage must be lifted by the force of
the cattle so as to surmount it; in either case
the road is injured, and the carriage impeded,
and the injury and impediment will be great
in the exact proportion to the number and size
of the obstacles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The size of stones for a road has been described
in contracts in several different ways,
sometimes as the size of a hen’s egg, sometimes
at half a pound weight. These descriptions
are very vague, the first being an indefinite
size, and the latter depending on the density
of the stone used, and <i>neither</i> being attended
to in the execution. The size of stone
used on a road must be in due proportion to
the space occupied by a wheel of ordinary dimensions
on a smooth level surface, this point
of contact will be found to be, longitudinally
about an inch, and every piece of stone put
into a road, which exceeds an inch in any of
its dimensions, is mischievous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The roads in Scotland are worse than those
in England, although, materials are more
abundant, of better quality, and labour at
<i>least</i> as cheap, and the toll duties are nearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>double; this is because road-making, that is
the surface, is even worse understood in Scotland
than in England. By a late discussion
in Parliament on the subject of Mail Coaches
paying toll, it was universally allowed that
the roads in Scotland were in a deplorable
state, and in their circumstances, bankrupt.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—<i>It is understood, that the Postmaster-General
was obliged to give up the mail-coach
from Glasgow to Ayr, on the road towards Ireland,
on account of the expence of tolls, and the
bad condition of the road; there being ten turnpike
gates on thirty-four miles of road.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>During nearly five years that the writer has
given his whole attention to the improvement of
the Turnpike Roads, experience having confirmed
his ideas on the subject, no endeavours
have been spared, to extend the benefits which
have already resulted to the Bristol district, over
the whole country. The very limited means
possessed by any individual for influencing this
important branch of domestic economy, has occasioned
frequent attempts to convey instructions
for road-making in writing. This method
has never been entirely successful; it being impossible
to acquire a mechanical art without
actual practice; or to obtain any just ideas of it,
beyond the first principles, from books.</p>

<p class='c007'>These principles are, that a road ought to be
considered as an artificial flooring forming a
strong, smooth, solid surface, at once capable of
carrying great weight, and over which carriages
may pass without meeting any impediment.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>No addition of materials is to be brought upon a road,
unless in any part of it be found that there is not a quantity
of clean stone equal to ten inches in thickness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stone already in the road is to be loosened up and broken,
so as no piece shall exceed six ounces in weight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The road is then to be laid as flat as possible, a rise of
three inches from the centre to the side is sufficient for a road
thirty feet wide.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stones when loosened in the road are to be gathered
off by means of a strong heavy rake, with teeth two and a
half inches in length, to the side of the road, and there
broken, and on no account are stones to be broken <i>on</i> the
road.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the great stones have been removed, and none left
in the road exceeding six ounces, the road is to be put in
shape and a rake employed to smooth the surface, which will
at the same time bring to the surface the remaining stone,
and will allow the dirt to go down.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the road is so prepared, the stone that has been
broken by the side of the road is then to be carefully spread
on it—this is rather a nice operation, and the future quality
of the road will greatly depend on the manner in which it is
performed. The stone must not be laid on in shovels full,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>but scattered over the surface, one shovel full following
another and spreading over a considerable space.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only a small space of road should be lifted at once; five
men in a gang should be set to lift it <i>all across</i>: two men
should continue to pick up and rake off the large stones and
to form the road for receiving the broken stone, the other
three should break stones—the broken stone to be laid on as
soon as the piece of road is prepared to receive it, and then
break up another piece; two or three yards at one lift is
enough.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proportioning the work among the five men must of
course be regulated by the nature of the road; when there
are many very large stones, the three breakers may not be
able to keep pace with the two men employed in lifting and
forming, and when there are few large stones the contrary
may be the case; of all this the Surveyor must judge and
direct.</p>

<p class='c007'>But while it is recommended to lift and relay roads which
have been made with large stone, or with large stone mixed
with clay, chalk or other mischievous materials, there are
many cases in which it would be highly unprofitable to lift
and relay a road, even if the materials should have been
originally too large.</p>

<p class='c007'>The road between Cirencester and Bath is made of stone
too large in size, but it is of so friable a nature that in lifting
it becomes sand; in this case I recommended cutting down
the high places, keeping the surface smooth and gradually
wearing out the materials now in the road, and then replacing
them with some stone of a better quality properly prepared.</p>

<p class='c007'>In like manner a part of the road in the Bath district is
made of freestone which it would be unprofitable to lift.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Egham in Surrey, it was necessary to remove the whole
road to separate the small portion of valuable materials from
the mass of soft matter of which it was principally composed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>which was removed at considerable expence, before a road
could be again made upon the site.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other cases of several kinds have occurred where a different
method must be adopted, but which it is impossible to
specify, and must be met by the practical skill of the Officer
whose duty it may be to superintend the repair of a road,
and who must constantly recur to general principles. These
principles are uniform, however much circumstances may
differ, and they must form the guide by which his judgment
must be always directed.</p>

<p class='c007'>When additional stone is wanted on a road that has consolidated
by use, the old hardened surface of the road is to
be loosened with a pick, in order to make the fresh materials
unite with the old.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carriages, whatever be the construction of their wheels,
will make ruts in a new-made road until it consolidates,
however well the materials may be prepared, or however
judiciously applied; therefore a careful person must attend
for some time after the road is opened for use, to rake in the
track made by wheels.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only proper method of breaking stones, both for effect
and economy, is by persons <i>sitting</i>; the stones are to be
placed in small heaps, and women, boys, or old men past
hard labour, must sit down with small hammers and break
them, so as none shall exceed six ounces in weight.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Tools to be used are,—</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Strong picks, but short from the handle to the point, for
lifting the road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Small hammers of about one pound weight in the head,
the face the size of a new shilling, well steeled, with a short
handle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rakes with wooden heads, ten inches in length, and iron
teeth about two and a half inches in length, very strong for
raking out the large stones when the road is broken up, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>for keeping the road smooth after being relaid, and while it
is consolidating.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very light broad-mouthed shovels, to spread the broken
stone and to form the road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every road is to be made of broken stone without mixture
of earth, clay, chalk, or any other matter that will imbibe
water, and be affected with frost; nothing is to be laid on
the clean stone on pretence of <i>binding</i>; broken stone will
combine by its own angles into a smooth solid surface that
cannot be affected by vicissitudes of weather, or displaced
by the action of wheels, which will pass over it without a
jolt, and consequently without injury.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>PRICES.</h4>

<p class='c006'>The price of lifting a rough road, breaking the stones,
forming the road, smoothing the surface, cleaning out the
watercourses, and replacing the stone, leaving the road in a
finished state, has been found in practice to be from one
penny to two-pence per superficial yard, lifted four inches
deep; the variation of price depends on the greater or lesser
quantity of stone to be broken.</p>

<p class='c007'>At two-pence per yard, a road of six yards wide will cost,
therefore, one shilling per running yard, or 88l. per mile.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any rough road may be rendered smooth and solid at this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>price, unless it be weak and require an addition of stone, or
require some very material alteration of shape.</p>

<p class='c007'>Breaking stone has been reduced in price by the use of
more proper hammers, and the sitting posture.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Commissioners at Bristol used to pay fifteen pence
per ton for limestone from Durdham Down, for the use of
their roads, and broken to a size above twenty ounces.—Stone
is now procured from the same place, broken so as
none exceed six ounces for ten-pence per ton! and the
workmen are very desirous of contracts at that rate, because
the heavy work is done by the men, the light work with small
hammers by the wives and children, so that whole families
are employed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Sussex, the proportion is greater between former and
present prices; the breaking of flint cost at one time two
shillings per ton, and is now done, by introducing a better
method and fitter tools at one shilling per ton.</p>

<p class='c007'>By a more judicious preparation and application of materials
the quantity of stone consumed in roads is decreased,
by which a great saving of expence is made, and with this
great advantage, that the saving is in horse labour of cartage,
while the labour price is given to men, and in such a
manner as includes boys from the age of ten upwards, women
and old men past the age of being able to labour hard.
The proportion of men and horse labour in the Bristol district,
under the former management, was</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>One-fourth to men’s labour,</div>
      <div class='line'>Three-fourths to horse labour.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Under a better system of management the proportion has
been exactly reversed: during half a year that an exact account
was kept, there was paid.</p>

have endeavoured to introduce on the construction
of roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the late winter, and particularly in
the month of January, 1820, when the frost was
succeeded by a sudden thaw, accompanied by
the melting of snow, the roads of the kingdom
broke up in a very alarming manner, and to an
extent that created great loss and inconvenience
by the interruption of communication, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>delay of the mails, and also occasioned a very
heavy extra expenditure by the Post-office.</p>

<p class='c007'>The obvious cause of this defect of the roads,
was the admission of water from the loose and
unskilful method of their construction. Previous
to the severe frost, the roads were filled with
water, which had penetrated through the ill-prepared
and unskilfully laid materials: this
caused an immediate expansion of the whole
mass during the frost, and upon a sudden thaw,
the roads became quite loose, and the wheels of
carriages penetrated to the original soil, which
was also saturated with water, from the open
state of the road. By this means, many roads
became altogether impassable, while the whole
were rendered deep and inconvenient to be travelled
upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>In particular, it was observed, that <i>all</i> the
roads of which chalk was a component part,
became, generally, impassable; and even, that
the roads made over chalk soils gave way in most
places. This evidently proceeded from the absorbent
quality of chalk, which renders it so
tenacious of water, that I consider its use to be
one of the most dangerous errors in road making.
I was induced on former occasions to recommend
particular care in making roads over chalk
soils, and to advise a discontinuance of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>practice of mixing chalk, clay, or any other
matter that holds water, with the materials of a
road. The experience of last winter has confirmed
this opinion, and has shewn the ruinous
effects of the former method.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all the roads which have been thoroughly
re-made, according to the directions which I
had the honour to submit to your Honourable
Board last spring, not one has given way, nor
has any delay taken place through the severity
of the late season.</p>

<p class='c007'>As every winter has, in some degree, presented
such inconveniences, and as it has been observed
that very severe winters occur in England
every six or seven years, it is of great consequence
to consider of the means of constructing
the roads of the kingdom in such a manner as
shall prevent their being in future affected by
any change of weather or season.</p>

<p class='c007'>The roads can never be rendered thus perfectly
secure, until the following principles be
fully understood, admitted, and acted upon:
namely, that it is the native soil which really
supports the weight of traffic: that while it is
preserved in a dry state, it will carry any weight
without sinking, and that it does in fact carry
the road and the carriages also; that this native
soil must previously be made quite dry, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>covering impenetrable to rain, must then be
placed over it, to preserve it in that dry state;
that the thickness of a road should only be regulated
by the quantity of material necessary to
form such impervious covering, and never by any
reference to its <i>own</i> power of carrying weight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The erroneous opinion so long acted upon,
and so tenaciously adhered to, that by placing
a large quantity of stone under the roads, a remedy
will be found for the sinking into wet clay,
or other soft soils, or in other words, that a road
may be made sufficiently strong, <i>artificially</i>, to
carry heavy carriages, though the sub-soil be in
a wet state, and by such means to avert the inconveniences
of the natural soil receiving water
from rain, or other causes, has produced most of
the defects of the roads of Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c007'>At one time I had formed the opinion that
this practice was only a useless expence, but experience
has convinced me that it is likewise positively
injurious.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well known to every skilful and observant
road-maker, that if strata of stone of various
sizes be placed as a road, the largest stones will
constantly work up by the shaking and pressure
of the traffic, and that the only mode of keeping
the stones of a road from motion, is to use materials
of a uniform size from the bottom. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>roads made upon large stones as a foundation,
the perpetual motion, or change of the position
of the materials, keeps open many apertures
through which the water passes.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has also been found, that roads placed upon
a hard bottom, wear away more quickly than
those which are placed upon a soft soil. This
has been apparent upon roads where motives of
economy, or other causes, have prevented the
road being lifted to the bottom at once; the
wear has always been found to diminish, as soon
as it was possible to remove the hard foundation.
It is a known fact, that a road lasts much longer
over a morass than when made over rock. The
evidence produced before the Committee of the
House of Commons, shewed the comparison on
the road between Bristol and Bridgwater, to be
as five to seven in favour of the wearing on the
morass, where the road is laid on the naked surface
of the soil, against a part of the same road
made over rocky ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practice common in England, and universal
in Scotland, on the formation of a new
road, is, to dig a trench below the surface of the
ground adjoining, and in this trench to deposit
a quantity of large stones; after this, a second
quantity of stone, broken smaller, generally to
about seven or eight pounds weight; these previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>beds of stone are called the bottoming of
the road, and are of various thickness, according
to the caprice of the maker, and generally
in proportion to the sum of money placed at his
disposal. On some new roads, made in Scotland,
in the summer of 1819, the thickness exceeded
three feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>That which is properly called the road, is
then placed on the bottoming, by putting large
quantities of broken stone or gravel, generally a
foot or eighteen inches thick, at once upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Were the materials of which the road itself is
composed, properly selected, prepared, and laid,
some of the inconveniences of this system might
be avoided; but in the careless way in which
this service is generally performed, the road is
as open as a sieve to receive water; which penetrates
through the whole mass, is received and
retained in the trench, whence the road is liable
to give way in all changes of weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>A road formed on such principles has never
effectually answered the purpose which the road-maker
should constantly have in view; namely,
to make a secure, level flooring, over which carriages
may pass with safety, and equal expedition,
at all seasons of the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>If it be admitted, as I believe it is now very
generally, that in this kingdom an artificial road
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>is only required to obviate the inconvenience of
a very unsettled climate; and that water with
alternate frost and thaw, are the evils to be
guarded against, it must be obvious that
nothing can be more erroneous than providing
a reservoir for water under the road and giving
facility to the water to pass through the road
into this trench, where it is acted upon by frost
to the destruction of the road.</p>

<p class='c007'>As no artificial road can ever be made so
good, and so useful as the natural soil in a <i>dry
state</i>, it is only necessary to procure, and preserve
this dry state of so much ground as is
intended to be occupied by a road.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first operation in making a road should
be the reverse of digging a trench. The road
should not be sunk below, but rather raised
above, the ordinary level of the adjacent ground,
care should at any rate be taken, that there be
a sufficient fall to take off the water, so that it
should always be some inches below the level
of the ground upon which the road is intended
to be placed: this must be done, either by
making drains to lower ground, or if that be not
practicable, from the nature of the country, then
the soil upon which the road is proposed to be
laid, must be raised by addition, so as to be
some inches above the level of the water.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Having secured the soil from under water,
the road-maker is next to secure it from rain
water, by a solid road, made of clean, dry stone,
or flint, so selected, prepared, and laid, as to be
perfectly impervious to water: and this cannot
be effected, unless the greatest care be taken,
that no earth, clay, chalk, or other matter, that
will hold or conduct water, be mixed with the
broken stone; which must be so prepared and
laid, as to unite by its own angles into a firm,
compact, impenetrable body.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thickness of such road is immaterial, as
to its strength for carrying weight; this object
is already obtained by providing a dry surface,
over which the road is to be placed as a covering,
or roof, to preserve it in that state: experience
having shewn, that if water passes through
a road, and fill the native soil, the road, whatever
may be its thickness, loses its support, and
goes to pieces.</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of an alteration in the line of
the turnpike road, near Rownham Ferry, in
the parish of Ashton, near Bristol, it has been
necessary to remove the old road. This road
was lifted and relaid very skilfully in 1816;
since which time it has been in contemplation
to change the line, and consequently, it has been
suffered to wear very thin. At present it is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>above three inches thick in most places, and
in none more than four: yet on removing the
road it was found, that no water had penetrated,
nor had the frost affected it during all the late
winter; and the natural earth beneath the road
was found perfectly dry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several new roads have been constructed an
this principle within the last three years. Part
of the great north road from London by Hoddesdon
in Hertfordshire—two pieces of road on
Durdham Down, and at Rownham Ferry, near
Bristol—with several private roads, in the eastern
part of Sussex.</p>

<p class='c007'>None of those roads exceed six inches in
thickness, and although that on the great north
road is subjected to a very heavy traffic, (being
only fifteen miles distant from London) it has
not given way, nor was it affected by the late
severe winter; when the roads between that
and London became impassable, by breaking up
to the bottom, and the mails and other coaches
were obliged to reach London by circuitous
routes. It is worthy of observation, that these
bad roads cost more money per mile for their
annual repair, than the original making of this
useful new road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Improvement of roads, upon the principle I
have endeavoured to explain, has been rapidly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>extended during the last four years. It has
been carried into effect, on various roads, and
with every variety of material, in seventeen different
counties. These roads being so constructed
as to exclude water, consequently none
of them broke up during the late severe winter;
there was no interruption to travelling, nor any
additional expense by the Post-office in conveying
the mails over them, to the extent of upwards
of one thousand miles of road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many new roads, and to a considerable extent,
are projected for the ensuing season. Some
of them are to be assisted by grants or loans
from government, and it will be a great saving
of property, and enable government to extend
their assistance more effectually, if these roads
be made in the most approved and economical
manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The unnecessary expense attending the making
of new roads in the manner hitherto practised,
is one great cause of the present heavy debt
upon the road trusts of the kingdom. The
principal part of the large sums originally borrowed,
have been sunk in the useless, and in
my opinion, mischievous preparation, of a foundation.
This debt presses heavily on the funds
of all the roads in England, and, in many cases,
absorbs almost their whole revenue in payment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>of interest. In Scotland this pressure is still
more heavily felt: indeed it is not of uncommon
occurrence in that country, for creditors
to lose both principal and interest of their loans
to roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>This causes not only a great and unnecessary
loss in the first instance, and a deficiency of
means for ordinary repair, and maintenance of
the roads, but it also discourages the formation
of new roads. Were a better and more economical
system generally adopted and acted upon,
many great additions and improvements of the
communications of the country would take place,
from which, at present, the landholders are
deterred, by fear of the extent of the expense,
and the difficulty of obtaining loans of money.</p>

<p class='c007'>The measure of substituting pavements, for
convenient and useful roads, is a kind of desperate
remedy, to which ignorance has had
recourse. The badness, or scarcity of materials,
cannot be considered a reasonable excuse; because
the same quantity of stone required for
paving, is fully sufficient to make an excellent
road any where: and it must be evident, that
road materials of the best quality may be procured
at less cost than paving stone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very bad quality of the gravel round
London, combined with want of skill and exertion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>either to obviate its defects, or to procure
a better material, has induced several of the
small trusts, leading from that city, to have
recourse to the plan of paving their roads, as
far as their means will admit. Instead of applying
their ample funds to obtain good materials
for the roads, they have imported stone
from Scotland, and have paved their roads, at
an expense ten times greater than that of the
excellent roads lately made on some of the
adjoining trusts. Very few of these pavements
have been so laid as to keep in good order for any
length of time; so that a very heavy expense
has been incurred without any beneficial result,
and it is to be lamented that this wasteful and
ineffectual mode is upon the increase in the
neighbourhood of London.</p>

<p class='c007'>This practice has also been adopted in places
where the same motive cannot be adduced: in
Lancashire, almost all the roads are paved at
an enormous cost, and are, in consequence, proverbially
bad. At Edinburgh, where they have
the best and cheapest materials in the kingdom,
the want of science to construct good roads, has
led the trustees to adopt the expedient of pavements,
to a considerable extent; and at an expense
hardly credible, when compared with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>what would have been the cost of roads on the
best principles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The advantages of good roads, when compared
with pavements, are universally acknowledged;
the extension of pavement is therefore
to be deprecated as an actual evil, besides the
greatness of the expence. Pavements are particularly
inconvenient and dangerous on steep
ascents, such as the ascent to bridges, &amp;c. A
very striking example of this may be observed
on the London end of Blackfriars Bridge,
where heavy loads are drawn up with great
difficulty, and where more horses fall and receive
injury, than in any other place in the kingdom.
The pavement in such places should be lifted,
and converted into a good road; which may be
done with the same stone, at an expense not
exceeding ten-pence per square yard. This
road would be more lasting than the pavement,
and, when out of order, may be repaired at less
than one-tenth of the expense which relaying
the pavement would require.</p>

<p class='c007'>This measure has been adopted with great
success, and considerable saving of expense, in
the suburbs of Bristol, where the pavements
were taken up, and converted into good roads,
about three years ago.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>The advantages of the system recommended
is so obvious to common observation in the repair
of old roads, and has been practised to an
extent so considerable, during the last four
years, that the minds of most people have become
reconciled to it; and objections, founded
on old prejudice and suspicion, have given way
to experience, but the application of the same
principles to the construction of new roads, has
necessarily been much more limited. It will,
therefore, require more liberality and confidence
on the part of country gentlemen, and
also more patient investigation of the principles
on which the system is founded, before they will
allow of its adoption on new lines of road. It
is to be hoped, however, that the importance
of the subject will recommend it to general
consideration.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>REPORT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The Select Committee appointed to take into
consideration the Acts now in force regarding the <span class='sc'>Turnpike
Roads</span> and <span class='sc'>Highways</span> in <span class='sc'>England</span> and <span class='sc'>Wales</span>,
and the expediency of additional Regulations for their
better repair and preservation, and to report their Observations
thereupon from time to time to the House; and to
whom the Petitions of Joseph D. Bassett, John Richards
Reed, and John Martin; and of several Trustees of Turnpike
Roads in the Counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey,
and Sussex, were referred;—<span class='sc'>Have</span>, pursuant to the
Orders of the House, examined the matters to them referred,
and have agreed upon the following REPORT:</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee considered it their indispensable
duty to direct their first attention to the
Reports of former Committees, appointed to investigate
the same important subject; in these
Reports, as well as in the documents subjoined
to them, are to be found much scientific information,
and many valuable suggestions, which
have doubtless tended to aid the progress of improvement
in the art of making and preserving
roads. Still the object of amending the laws
which relate to them has been unattained, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>bills introduced with a partial view to that purpose
having been lost in their progress through
Parliament, and the suggestions for more general
improvements having been allowed to remain
without further notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>If your Committee may be permitted to assign
the probable reasons of this discouraging
result of the labours of their predecessors, they
would venture to suggest, that too wide a field
of inquiry was taken to lead to immediate practical
benefit: that some of the systems most confidently
recommended were of a novel and speculative
nature; that the regulations which it
was proposed to found on them too strongly
affected the interests of vested property; and
that even the most valuable information communicated
to the House rested upon ingenious
theories, which had then been very partially, if
at all, reduced to practice, or submitted to fair
experiment.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the considerations which influenced the
appointment of the present Committee, avowedly
sprang from the successful trial of an improved
system of making roads, your Committee
have judged it right to institute a particular
examination into all the circumstances of that
experiment, and the various instances in which
the example has been followed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Mr. John Loudon MᶜAdam having for many
years directed his attention, as a magistrate and
a commissioner, to the improvement of roads,
was induced to accept the situation of general
surveyor of an extensive trust round the city of
Bristol.</p>

<p class='c007'>The admirable state of repair into which the
roads under his direction were brought, attracted
very general attention; and induced the commissioners
of various districts to apply for his
assistance or advice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general testimony borne to his complete
success wherever he has been employed, and the
proof that his improvements have been attended
with an actual reduction of expense, while they
have afforded the most useful employment to the
poor, induce your Committee to attach a high
degree of importance to that which he has
already accomplished. The imitation of his
plans is rendered easy by their simplicity, and
by the candour with which he has explained
them, though ability in the surveyor to judge of
their application must be understood as an essential
requisite.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee have dwelt on this improved
system of making roads, as a preliminary consideration
to any alteration of the laws, being persuaded
that it is of essential importance to adapt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the law to new circumstances; that the first step
requisite is to take effectual measures for ensuring
the <i>formation</i> of good roads; and that their
preservation afterwards, if proper principles for
their repair be once adopted, will require fewer
legislative regulations than former inquirers have
deemed necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a full elucidation of the methods pursued
by Mr. MᶜAdam your Committee beg leave to
refer to his evidence in the Appendix annexed, as
well as to that of his son, and of different Commissioners
who had witnessed the success of his
plans.</p>

<p class='c007'>But though your Committee have limited
their first inquiries to the actual state of the turnpike
roads, and the results of recent plans for
their improvement, they have by no means confined
their researches to the operations or the
opinions of one individual. In the evidence
which they subjoin will be found, in the first
place, a description of the present general defects
of the turnpike roads, given by those whose
employments and interest render them best acquainted
with the nature and extent of the evil;
and this exposition is followed not only by the
detail of Mr. MᶜAdam’s system, already alluded
to, but by the evidence of other eminent surveyors
and civil engineers, under whose superintendence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>the latest and most perfect improvements
have been effected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee consider that high praise is
due to the superior science exhibited by Mr.
Telford, in tracing and forming the new roads
in North Wales; but they contented themselves
with a general inquiry into his plans, aware that
their merits would be particularly brought under
the eye of the House in the Reports of the
Committee on the Holyhead Roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>The concurrent testimony of all the witnesses
examined by your Committee establishes the fact
that the general state of the turnpike roads in
England and Wales is extremely defective, but
at the same time proves that proper management
is alone wanted to effect the most desirable
reformation. It is not the least interesting
result of the researches of your Committee, that
the most improved system is demonstrated to be
the most economical; that even the first effectual
repair of a bad road may be accomplished with
little, if any, increase of expenditure; and that
its future preservation in good order will, under
judicious management, be attended with a considerable
annual saving to the public.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no point upon which a more decided
coincidence of opinion exists amongst all those
who profess what may now be called the science
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>of road-making, than that the first effectual step
towards general improvement must be the employment
of persons of superior ability and experience
as superintending surveyors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee, fully concurring in this
opinion, have anxiously considered in what manner
this object can be attained with the least
expense to the country, and the least injurious
or offensive interference with existing customs
and authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Various are the plans which have been
brought under their consideration for altering
the general constitution of the laws affecting
the management of Turnpike Roads, proposing
either to annex the superintendence and patronage
to some of the existing departments of
Government, or to constitute a new Board of
Commissioners expressly for this object.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee forbear to detail the reasons
which induce them to withhold their recommendation
from any of these plans, whatever
advantages they might afford in unity or vigour
of management.</p>

<p class='c007'>They are of opinion, that many important
reasons exist for leaving generally the direction
of the affairs of the different turnpike trusts in
the hands of their respective Commissioners,
whose experience, character and interest, afford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the best pledges of ability, attention and economy.
If your Committee think it necessary
to propose, in one respect, an interference with
their appointments, it by no means proceeds
from any distrust of their judgment or integrity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The duties of a head surveyor demand
suitable education and talents. These qualifications
must be fairly remunerated; and it is
evident, that the limited extent of the funds of
Turnpike Trusts, in general, do not afford the
means of paying to such an officer an adequate
salary. The difficulty might in many instances
be obviated by voluntary associations, but where
the system is wished to be universal, it ought
not to be left to so precarious a dependence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plan to which your Committee, after
full consideration, are disposed to give the
preference, is that of empowering the magistrates
of every county, assembled in quarter
sessions, to appoint one or more surveyors general,
who shall have the superintendence and
management of the turnpike roads within the
county, under the authority and direction of the
Commissioners of the different trusts. It is
not necessary at present to enter on the detailed
regulations by which the executive duties of
such an officer should be prescribed, so as to
keep them under the deliberative control of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Commissioners, whose meetings he should attend,
and to whom he should uniformly report
on the improvements and alterations he may
wish to recommend within their trusts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee are of opinion, that the
most eligible mode of paying the salary of this
officer would be by an uniform rate per mile
upon all the roads within the county; to be
fixed by the magistrates at quarter sessions, and
paid from the funds of the respective trusts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The success of this plan of appointing general
county surveyors will, in a great degree,
depend upon the firmness evinced by the magistrates,
in laying aside every consideration of
personal favour, and impartially looking to integrity,
talents, and energy of character, as the
recommendations for office; some skill in the
science of an engineer should also be regarded
as a valuable qualification.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee have manifested their general
disinclination to any interference with the
honourable and gratuitous discharge of the
functions of the Commissioners of Turnpike
Trusts; in one instance, however, they are
disposed to depart from the principle which
they have recommended. A full consideration of
the evidence relative to the defective state, and
injudicious management of the roads round the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Metropolis, and of the advantages which would
accrue from a consolidation of the numerous
small Trusts into which they are most inconveniently
divided, induce your Committee to
express to the House their strong recommendation,
that a special Act of Parliament may be
passed for uniting all the Trusts within a distance
of about ten miles round London under
one set of Commissioners. It is to these roads
that the heaviest complaints made by the coachmasters,
and the surveyor of mail coaches under
the post-office, principally apply; and whether
an improvement is to be effected by the importation
of flint, and other common materials,
or by laying granite pavement in the centre or
sides of the roads, it is evident that, “the
measure to be performed in an economical and
efficient manner, must be done upon an extended
scale it must become one interest, directed
by one select body of men, of weight, ability,
and character.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the object of the recommendation of
your Committee to render the roads round the
Metropolis a pattern for the kingdom, by the
introduction of the most judicious system of
formation and repair, which will thus be brought
under general inspection; and the spirit of
improvement, radiating from this centre, may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>be expected to spread with rapidity throughout
the country, and to diffuse “those incalculable
public and private advantages,” which a former
Committee anticipated from the accomplishment
of this great national object.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee are deeply sensible of the
consideration due to the persons whose property
is invested in the funds of these Trusts, as well
as to those who now act as Commissioners.
They are perfectly aware of the jealousy with
which the House may view any proposition
for the creation of new offices of patronage and
profit; and they do not disguise their conviction,
that it will be found expedient to remunerate
those efficient Commissioners who are
expected to devote their time to the performance
of active duties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee however anticipate, that if
the House shall approve the formation of a
Board of Commissioners for this object, they
will deem it proper to place at its head some
persons of eminent station and character, as a
security for the independence and respectability
of its proceedings.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these considerations certainly require cautious
deliberation, and delicacy in arranging the
plan; but your Committee feel confident that
the wisdom and judgment of the House will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>find the means of surmounting the difficulties,
without injustice, or hazardous innovation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is obvious, that the formation of this distinct
central authority will be best effected by
the introduction of a separate Bill, while the
plan of empowering the magistrates to appoint
county surveyors would naturally form part of
a general Bill for amending the laws relating
to Turnpike Roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee have weighed, with much
attention, the comparative advantages of an
attempt to amend these laws by supplemental
enactments, and of the comprehensive plan of
endeavouring to embody in one Act of Parliament
all that is valuable in the old laws, with
the addition of such new regulations as are
acknowledged to be desirable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Committee of 1811 were impressed with
the expedience of “combining the old and
new regulations into one general code, divided
into two branches, one regarding the Highways,
and the other regarding Turnpike Roads,”
though they considered that “it would require
more time and labour than those who have not
had some experience in the drawing up of such
laws can be at all aware of.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your Committee do not hesitate to avow their
opinion, that unless this task, however arduous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>be accomplished, the laws relating to roads must
remain in an incomplete, uncertain, and inconvenient
state. They cannot doubt that the
House will agree with them that the promotion
of such a measure is deserving of legal assistance
on the part of his Majesty’s government, to
those who are disposed to apply their time and
attention to the undertaking; and they indulge
the hope, that if the House shall think fit to reappoint
a Committee for the same object in the
next session of Parliament, much may be found
done for the preparation of such a bill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee themselves have not been
inattentive to many of the amendments which
they think it ought to embrace, some of which
they proceed to particularize for the consideration
of those members whose attention may be
drawn to the subject of this Report.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no object which appears more deserving
of regulation than the expense attending
the passing and renewing of Turnpike Acts.
This might be lessened by comprising in a general
Act such customary clauses as are applicable
to all trusts, and by dispensing with the attendance
of witnesses in London to prove the notices
required by the orders of the House; but a still
greater advantage would be gained by extending
the period of the duration of these Acts, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>providing for their renewal without the payment
of fees.</p>

<p class='c007'>A general commutation for statute labour
appears to be required, both for public advantage
and private convenience. The amount
of composition might be levied as a rate; and it
will become a subject of consideration, whether
some better principle may not be laid down for
apportioning the money thus collected between
the highways and turnpike roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>The advantage of authorizing parish officers
to contract with the commissioners for the repair
of the roads passing through the parish by labourers
belonging to it, has been strongly pressed
on the attention of your Committee, but
though they are disposed to admit that such a
system may often afford desirable relief to the
parishes, they are not equally satisfied that it
will have a tendency to promote the improvement
of the roads. They think it right to bring
the proposition under the consideration of the
House, though they are too diffident of its utility
to venture to add to it their recommendation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems generally admitted, that the present
exemptions from toll granted to broad-wheeled
waggons require to be revised, as the enormous
weights which they carry render them more destructive
to the materials of the roads than their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>supposed advantage in consolidating them can
compensate. Without entering into the yet unsettled
controversy respecting the superior utility
of conical, barrelled, or cylindrical wheels, for
the purpose of draught, it is perfectly evident,
that the narrow part of the surface upon which
wheels of the two first descriptions meet the
ground, cannot give them the advantage of the
roller. As soon as impolitic exemptions shall
be abolished, and the tolls be regulated upon all
carts and waggons, with wheels of a moderate
width, in proportion either to the weight carried,
or the number of horses, there will no longer be
the same temptation to carry excessive loads;
and it is probable that a new practice, regulated
by private interest, may render it unnecessary
to limit the weight allowed to be taken.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some regulations appear to be absolutely
required in respect to the conduct of tollkeepers,
and the liability of renters, for the
penalties imposed on their servants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee have thus noticed a few of
those objects of amendment which have presented
themselves to their consideration. To reduce
these and other proposed improvements into
proper form—to digest the various provisions of
former Acts—to expunge what is useless or injurious,—to
reconcile what is contradictory—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>re-model and arrange what is sound and useful,
will require the assistance of the best legal
judgment. Your Committee however, after
having thus availed themselves of the power
granted by the house, of reporting the partial
result of their investigations, will continue to
make such inquiries, and to collect such materials,
as may pave the way for the accomplishment
of that important undertaking.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will at once be seen, that they have confined
themselves to one branch of the work committed
to them, having conceived it to be more
judicious not to distract their own attention and
that of the House by too many subjects of inquiry,
but to pursue that which they first undertook
to a practical result.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should the House adopt their recommendation
of renewing the Committee in another
session, the subject of the Highways will naturally
engage their attention as soon as they shall
have fully matured the plan for amending the
laws relating to the Turnpike Roads.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><i>Martis, 2º die Martij, 1819.</i><br /> EDWARD PROTHEROE, ESQUIRE,<br /> In the Chair.</h3>

<h4 class='c011'><i>Charles Johnson</i>, Esquire, called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>You are surveyor and superintendent of mail coaches under
the Post Master General?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>How long have you held that office?—Not twelve months
yet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Has your attention been directed, in the execution of the duties
of that office, to the state of the turnpike roads throughout
the kingdom?—I have given a general attention to the subject,
and I have had occasion, of course, to give particular attention
to it, when complaints have been made of loss of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what state of repair do you consider the turnpike roads to
be, generally throughout the kingdom?—I certainly (as far as I
have had an opportunity of inspecting them) consider, that almost
all the roads might be improved; but there are very few
instances in which I should have thought it necessary to advise
the Post Master General to interfere, except in the more immediate
neighbourhood of London.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not the practice of the Post-office to interfere in the mode
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>you mention, by indictment, unless the evil has arisen to a very
great pitch?—Not until it has arisen to a very considerable evil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider that the general defective state of the road
arises from any local disadvantages, or from mismanagement in
regard to the funds, or the application of materials?—That
question involves so many considerations, that I hardly know
how to give an answer to it; but I think, that in general one
may observe a great want of that skill in forming the road and
keeping it in repair, which is very obvious in some parts of the
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider that the defects you have mentioned in the
neighbourhood of London, arise from any local disadvantages,
or from the roads been worse managed?—It is generally understood
that in the neighbourhood of London they have not so
good materials to repair the roads with, being chiefly gravel;
but I think I may say, that there is certainly a want of attention
and of care.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you known instances in the neighbourhood of London
where better roads have been obtained by superior management?—In
the early part of the winter we were under such great difficulties
with respect to the Exeter mail coach, that I was under
the necessity of applying to the Egham trust. It was at that
time reported to me, that the whole town of Egham had been
covered with gravel unsifted, eight or nine inches deep from side
to side; the consequence of that was, that the mail coach lost
ten, fifteen, or twenty minutes every night. We were given
afterwards to understand that the commissioners had put that particular
road under the care of Mr. MᶜAdam, and at this time I
have no sort of occasion whatever to complain of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Generally speaking, do you consider that the mails are detained
more by the bad state of the roads in the neighbourhood of London
than elsewhere?—They certainly have more difficulty in
passing to and from London for the first fifty or sixty miles, than
in almost any other part of the country. It is in the nights we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>have the heaviest weights, and therefore it is very desirable
that the roads near town should be rather better, than worse than
others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Has your attention been particularly directed to the state of
the roads in other parts of the kingdom lately?—I travelled a
considerable distance last autumn in the north of England. Certainly
I considered the roads that I passed over there, to be very
superior in general to what they are in the first hundred miles
from the metropolis. Subsequently to that, I have had occasion
to travel throughout North Wales, and I gave particular attention
to the Holyhead line of road.</p>

<p class='c007'>By what road?—By Coventry. The roads which are found
in North Wales are remarkably good, and in my humble opinion,
show great science in the formation of them. The new roads I
mean. The materials in that country are of course very good.
On this side of Birmingham, which is also the road to Liverpool,
there is great occasion to complain, particularly from Dunchurch
to Daventry. At this time that road is in a very neglected
state, very heavy, narrow, and blocked up by banks of
drift. I have had occasion to apply to that trust, but I do not
learn that any thing has been done.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you found the system of indictment afford any effectual
remedy for the evils which you have had cause to observe in that
way?—I think we have. But there have been very few indictments
preferred for some years past; the postmaster general not
thinking it right to press upon the districts during the season of
agricultural distress. I should say, we do not consider that any
reason, at present, for abstaining.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you experienced from the commissioners, a disposition,
generally, to attend to such complaints as you have found occasion
to make?—Such applications as I have had occasion to make
appear to have been very well received; but I cannot say, that in
many instances the roads have been much improved. I will add
to this answer, that I lately passed over the road from Oxford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>through Henley to London; and although that is one of the
roads complained much of, it is certainly, at this time, in a very
improper state.</p>

<p class='c007'>In such cases do you not follow up your measures by stronger
proceedings, by indictment?—I think that in this case it would be
necessary to renew our applications, and perhaps to proceed by
indictment; but I have considered it prudent not to interfere,
chiefly in contemplation of the proceedings of this Committee.</p>

<p class='c007'>From what you have seen of the new roads in Wales, do you
not conceive that nearly all the turnpike roads in England are
capable of very considerable improvement, by an application of
equal skill in the disposition of the materials employed upon
them?—I certainly do.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>Mr. <i>William Waterhouse</i>, called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>You keep the Swan-with-two-Necks in Lad-lane?—I belong
to the premises; I don’t keep the house; I am the coachmaster.</p>

<p class='c007'>You are the proprietor of many mail and other coaches?—I
am.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the proprietor of mail and stage coaches, has your attention
been directed to the state of the roads over which they
travel?—Yes, it has.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inform the Committee whether you think the roads are in
such a state of repair as they might be, under proper management,
with the advantages they possess?—Taking them generally,
I think they are not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider that the amount of the tolls at present
received would be sufficient to place them in a state of good repair,
under proper management?—From what information I
have been able to obtain of the sums which the gates are let for
upon several trusts, it is my opinion that the money so received
is quite sufficient to put them in a very good state. For instance,
there is one trust, which is called the Daventry trust, leading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>from Old Stratford to Dunchurch; their tolls, I understand,
produce more than 100<i>l.</i> a mile per annum. Very little improvement
has been made in that trust; and the roads are very unsafe,
and in a bad condition altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider that that arises from want of proper materials,
or want of proper skill in making use of them?—From both.
The materials that they have in that neighbourhood, in my opinion,
are not good; and the people that they employ upon the
roads are not equal to the task, and therefore they are very much
neglected. The surveyors and the men that work under them
are insufficient.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you know of any instances where similar disadvantages
have been surmounted by proper skill and ingenuity?—I believe
I can state that upon one particular trust that has been the case.
I believe they call it the Hockliffe trust. It is but a short
distance, but very great improvements have been made upon it.
The great improvements that have been made there, I am informed
by several of the commissioners, have been done through
their skilful and attentive surveyors. They have improved that
trust very much indeed. I believe I can mention another road
out of London that has been much improved, I mean the Essex
road, (their surveyor being a clever man, and competent to understand
his business,) between Whitechapel church and Brentwood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are there any particular defects in the management of the
roads generally, which you think might be remedied, that you
can point out to the Committee?—In the first place, there may
be great improvements by the proper formation of the roads. I
know, in some places, particularly from here down to Colney,
where there is a clayey bottom, and upon that line of road there
are a great many land springs; those springs frequently work up
through the gravel, and injure the road very materially. When
that is the case I consider that they should under-drain the road,
and take away these land springs, which would be the means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>having the roads firm and hard, much harder than they are
now.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it not a common defect to place the gravel on the road
without being sufficiently sifted or washed?—Very much so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you not consider it as a bad system, likewise, to place the
gravel so much in the centre of the road, thereby rendering it
of too great convexity?—Yes, certainly. I think it is laid
generally too thick and too high in the middle. There is no
necessity for the roads being rounded so much.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you known any accidents to have arisen from the steepness
of the road?—Yes; several accidents with my coaches, as
well as those of other people, in consequence of the road being
laid so very high in the middle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is not that shape of the road likewise attended with a disadvantage
in the draft of the carriage?—I consider it so, inasmuch
as it flings the weight too much on one side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is not a great loss sustained by the proprietors of stage
coaches, in consequence of the badness of the roads, in the
wearing out of their horses?—Yes; particularly so the first fifty
or sixty miles from London.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the performance of time by the mail coaches,
do you find that you labour under greater difficulty on the roads
near London, than on those at a greater distance from town?—I
am certain we do. It requires a greater quantity of horses to
perform the duty, and, in my opinion, it requires ten horses to
perform the same number of miles for the first fifty out of London,
that might be done by eight, with the same speed, beyond
that distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is there any difference in the value of the horses used near
town and at a distance from it?—I can buy horses at 15<i>l.</i> a piece
that will perform the duty, at a distance from London, equal to
those that we are obliged to give 30<i>l.</i> a piece for, on the average,
for the work near town.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you in the habit of working coaches to a greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>than fifty miles from London?—Not at this time; I have worked
coaches as far as one hundred miles distance from London, and
I always found there that eight horses would perform as many
miles as ten, the first fifty miles out of London.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have not the tolls very much increased of late years under
new acts of parliament?—It is my opinion that the tolls generally
have doubled within these last fifteen years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have the roads improved in any degree in the same proportion?—No,
they have not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you calculated the average rate per mile which a coach
with four horses pays for toll?—I have: It is my opinion that
the average amount throughout the kingdom is 3½<i>d.</i> per mile;
it was above 3<i>d.</i> when I took them above twelve months ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you find that the horses wear out in a much shorter space
of time, in working coaches within the first fifty miles from
London, than they do lower down?—Yes they do very much.
We calculate that our stock of horses, employed in working the
first fifty miles out of London, will not last more than four
years; in the country, at a greater distance, I believe they calculate
that their stock, on an average, will last six years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you not frequently obliged to put six horses to your
coaches, on the roads from London?—Sometimes that is the
case; we do work with six horses where the roads are bad and
heavy. I may say, from the knowledge I have of one particular
road, namely, from London to Birmingham, it requires twelve
horses to perform the same number of miles as eight horses will
do between Birmingham and Holyhead.</p>

<p class='c007'>How many coach-horses do you keep?—About four hundred.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you acquainted with the new roads in North Wales, made
by Mr. Telford?—Yes, I am.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you think that three of your horses would draw the Holyhead
mail as easily on those roads as four of them do the same
coach on any part of the road from London to Dunchurch?—I
have no doubt about it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Does that arise from the construction of the road, or nature
of the materials, or both?—Both. The construction of the new
road is extraordinarily good, and the materials also are very
good.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state what particular construction those roads are of?—They
are laid in a form sufficiently round to wash themselves,
if there is a shower of rain that comes upon them. They are
not very high; and their excellence consists in the smallness of
the convexity. They are in the best form I have ever seen roads
made.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>Mr. <i>William Horne</i>, called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>You keep the Golden Cross Inn, Charing Cross?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>You are the proprietor of many mail and stage coaches?—I
am.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your attention of course has been directed to the state of the
roads over which they travel?—It has.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you inform the Committee in what state the roads generally
are, in point of goodness?—I think in general they have
been better for the last seven years than formerly, though they
are now bad. They are generally bad, and might be very much
improved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state to the Committee any particular instances of
improvement that have taken place within your own knowledge?—Yes;
one between London and Hounslow, which must be
known to every body to have been very bad; that road has been
made good, which was extremely bad before.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider that the application of the materials upon
that road is at present good?—Yes. It is the better construction
of the road, together with the different materials from what
they used formerly, which have been the means of making that
road better. They have brought chalk and flints from Kent by
the canal, and have got them at as small an expense as gravel;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and these have formed a hard well-bound road, which was formerly
bad.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon what other roads do your coaches travel?—I will mention
one which is precisely the contrary, the Uxbridge road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gravel is usually employed on that?—Solely gravely and the
road is very flat. It is made lower than the fields, which draws
the water upon it, and therefore it cannot be drawn off from it.
That is the chief cause of the road being so bad.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it not the practice upon that road to pile up the scrapings
or drift by the side of the road?—It is.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within your experience, do you consider that the goodness
of the roads is at all in proportion to the local advantages or disadvantages;
or have you found that the skill and experience of
the surveyors employed upon them have effected particular improvements?—They
chiefly depend upon having good surveyors.
The Dover road will show that more than any other road I
know of. I can remember that within these seven years, what
was then called “The Sun in the Sands” has been made a very
good road. That road was all loose and sandy: they have
drained it, and it is now a very good road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state under whose superintendence that road is
placed?—Mr. Collis’s. He is now employed on the Brighton
road, effecting the same sort of improvement; reducing hills,
and making the road good.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you find that the roads on which your coaches travel, are
much worse in the neighbourhood of London than the more
distant parts?—I find them worse for coaches near London, but
it may be attributed partly to the greater quantity of travelling
near London to what there is in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are the horses that you employ in the stages near London of
superior value to those that are employed at a greater distance?—It
differs according to the carriage. I think with the stage
coaches, the horses out of London are considerably more in
value than those employed at a greater distance from London;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>and as to mail coaches, <i>vice versa</i>. In the country, the day
stock of the coaches is very good, but in the night they work
them very badly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you find that your horses that are employed in the stages
near London, wear out sooner than those at a greater distance?—Much
sooner, I should think. I employ about four hundred
horses myself, and I am sure I buy one hundred and fifty a year
to support the number, and keep the stock in order. I consider
that my stock wears out fully in three years.</p>

<p class='c007'>How much longer on an average, will horses last at a distance
from town?—I should think double the time: for these reasons;
first, the work is lighter, and next, the food is better; besides
which, the lodging of them is better; the stables are airy and
more healthy; they have not so often diseases in the country as
we have in London.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you in the habit of working coaches to any great distance
from London?—I work them half way to Bristol; with Mr.
Pickwick of Bath, I work to Newbury.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you know whether the horses that are employed still
lower down upon that road, are considered to have lighter or
heavier work?—I should not keep larger horses for that work
myself; I should keep short-legged horses, because of the hills.</p>

<p class='c007'>Which are of less value?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Speaking generally, if the same skill and management that
you have mentioned in particular districts were generally employed,
do you not think that the roads of England and Wales
might be put into a very perfect state of repair?—I think, that
with better direction as to management, they might be put into
a much better state of repair, at the same cost, than they now
are. There is a road, called the North-east Road (the way
that the Edinburgh mail comes,) which is much improved
lately, and without any great expense.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under whose management is that road?—Of a Mr. Clay.
It has been done by rolling the road, and breaking the gravel to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>a certain size, not putting it on too large or too small; and
taking care to turn the road well. If the road is not turned
well, it never will be good.</p>

<p class='c007'>This roller is a late invention, is it not?—It is. It impresses
the gravel, or whatever the material is, into the ground, before
the road is scraped; then they proceed to scrape it and take the
slush off; this rolls down the ruts as well.</p>

<p class='c007'>And from your experience, you have every reason to believe
that it is of great advantage to the road?—I have worked the
Tyburn road, and the White Cross roads, which were as bad as
the Tyburn till this practice has been introduced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you know any thing of the Reading road, which Mr.
MᶜAdam has had the superintendence of?—It is a very fair road;
it is the best piece of road in that direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you inform the Committee the weights you are accustomed
to carry upon the different descriptions of carriages, mail
coaches, post coaches, and heavy coaches?—The post coach
loaded is 38 cwt. weight; it is never more than two tons. The
mail coach also is not more than two tons, I should think. As
to heavy coaches, I only work two of that description out of the
40 coaches that are in my own yard; they are so little used, that
they don’t generally weigh more than the post coach; they don’t
carry so much luggage.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is the weight of the heavy coach?—Not more than the
post, because they don’t carry so much luggage as some of the
post coaches. I reckon 12 passengers one ton, coach one ton,
and luggage half a ton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you known of any accidents to your coaches arising
from the great convexity of the roads in the neighbourhood of
London?—I have had accidents, and they have sometimes been
attributed to the horses shying, and plunging the coach on one
side, so as to cause it to overturn, from the great roundness of
the road.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>
  <h4 class='c011'>Mr. <i>John Eames</i>, called in; and Examined.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>You keep the White Horse, Fetter-lane, and are the proprietor
of the Angel Inn, St. Clement’s?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>You are the proprietor of several mail and stage coaches?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>How many horses do you keep?—About three hundred.</p>

<p class='c007'>What are the principal roads you are in the habit of working
from London?—We work the Canterbury, the Cambridge, the
Dover, the Norwich, the Portsmouth, and some others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you find that you sustain much inconvenience from the
state of the roads over which you travel?—Yes. As to inconvenience,
I find much more in the neighbourhood of London
than the more distant parts.</p>

<p class='c007'>How long do you find that your horses upon an average last,
that are employed in the first stages from London?—My horses,
upon an average, don’t last above three years in the fast coaches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Including the mails?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>And those horses in the neighbourhood of London, are of
greater value than those employed at a distance?—They are.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon an average, how long do the horses last that are employed
in the more distant parts?—They last as long again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you attribute that in a great degree to the badness of the
roads in the neighbourhood of London?—I attribute it to the
distress the horse receives from the badness of the roads near
town; but I attribute it also in a great degree to the meeting of
different carriages, and crossing the road, which makes it more
laborious to the horse, though he does not appear to go so many
miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you not consider that that particular evil is occasioned in
a great degree by the convexity of the roads in the neighbourhood
of London, the materials being generally heaped up in the
middle?—I do; it “tears their hearts out,” as the coachmen express
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>it. The roads are inconvenient from the quantity and
quality of the gravel heaped in the middle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you known any instances in which a different system has
been pursued, and the roads greatly improved, in the neighbourhood
of London?—The road from London to Cranford Bridge
has been improved of late, and from London to Hounslow more
particularly, in consequence of the pavement in the crown of the
road, which has done away with the gravelling, or shingle rather.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is not the gravel upon that road generally employed without
sifting or washing?—It is half clay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you known instances in which this inconvenience has
been remedied by superior skill and experience in the surveyor
of the roads?—Yes; in the same line of road that Mr. Horne
referred to; in the Kent road particularly.</p>

<p class='c007'>If that same skill was employed in the application of materials
to the other roads, do you not think that they might be brought
generally to the same state of improvement?—I have no doubt
of it; there is no question about it. The Surrey road has been
improved on the same principle.</p>

<p class='c007'>What do you call the Surrey road?—From London to
Guildford.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you know under whose management that is?—I don’t
know now; a person named Baker had the management of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Was it under him it was improved?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>How many miles of road does that consist of?—Thirty miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it is very much improved?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>By what means?—The materials are harder than the gravel.
He brings the rag flints and breaks them, but in a different
manner from other parts of the road. He has improved it so
much, that it does not look the same road at all; I can go now
sixteen miles better than I could twelve before.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider that the horses which travel these roads that
have been improved, last longer than formerly?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>You need hardly be asked whether these improvements enable
you to carry passengers at a lower rate than before?—Of course;
it is the expense of the stock that is the great thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the roads were generally improved, travelling would be
cheaper?—Of course.</p>

<h3 class='c003'><i>Veneris, 21º die Maii, 1819.</i></h3>

<h4 class='c011'>Mr. <i>George Botham</i>, called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>You keep the George Inn, at Newbury?—I do.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you a proprietor of mail and other coaches?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>To a considerable extent?—Yes, and have been for some
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>How many horses have you?—More than a hundred.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your attention has of course been directed to the state of the
road between Newbury and London?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>State any improvement that has taken place in that road?—There
is a very great improvement between Marlborough and
Twyford.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under whose directions?—Mr. MᶜAdam.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what state was that road before?—It was in a very bad
state, and I mentioned it to lord Aylesbury, and he applied to
get the materials, and offered to give up any quantity of his land
for the widening of the road, which he has done.</p>

<p class='c007'>In point of fact the road has been widened?—Much widened
and much improved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state what improvement it would make in the draught
of the carriages?—Not exactly, but I consider it a very great
one.</p>

<p class='c007'>You cannot state any proportion of the labour of horses in
drawing a carriage?—No, not particularly so; I did not expect
to be asked, but it is not very material.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>In what state is that road, compared with the road from Twyford
to London?—I consider the road from Twyford to be a
little mended, but it is very bad at present.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you think by the adoption of the same system the road
from Twyford to London might be equally improved?—I have
no doubt of it; the materials are better.</p>

<p class='c007'>Which of course would make a great difference in the ease of
working your coaches?—Yes; I should think we could perform
the journey from Newbury to Reading in a quarter of an
hour’s less time, which is seventeen miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you, as proprietor of mail coaches, had occasion to
express any dissatisfaction to the Post Office, with regard to
your present contracts?—Certainly, with very great reason.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you think that you should be enabled to continue those
contracts at the present rate, if the roads are not put into a
better state of repair?—That entirely depends upon the price of
corn; we were very great sufferers till lately, that corn has fallen
so much: or else my brother, as well as myself, intended to
quit the mails, because we were losing a great deal of money.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider that the system of repairing roads, which
has been adopted in that part of the road which you have described
as under the superintendance of Mr. MᶜAdam, is superior
to any other that you have seen adopted?—Certainly, I
am sure it is, there is no question about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>And that its general adoption would be highly beneficial to
the coach proprietors, and to the public?—Most certainly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. <i>Fromont</i> being prevented by an accident from attending
the Committee, it was resolved that the following Letter be

      <div class='line'>Gentlemen,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>I think it a duty incumbent on me to present to you my
opinion respecting Mr. MᶜAdam’s plan of repairing and improving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>turnpike roads. From what I have noticed of his improvement
on different parts of the Bath road, on which I am at
present working different coaches a distance of above 500 miles
per day, I think his plan altogether, <i>i. e.</i> first of screening and
cleansing the gravel, and breaking the stones; secondly, of
preparing the road to receive it; and thirdly, of laying it on the
road, is the best and safest method I have ever seen in the
course of fifty years experience in the coach and waggon business.
I have formerly had several accidents happen from the
gravel being laid too thick and very high in the middle of the
road; and have killed some hundreds of horses (extra) in
pulling through it; and I think I may venture to say, that if
Mr. MᶜAdam’s plan was adopted generally throughout the
kingdom, in the course of a short time the public would be
enabled to travel with much greater ease and safety, and at
nearly one-third less of expense; at all events I am convinced
that nearly one-third less labour is required to work a fast
coach over part of the road between Reading and London,
where MᶜAdam’s plan has been adopted, than there is over
other parts of the road where they still continue the old plan
In short, my opinion may be given in a few words; his plan, if
adopted generally, will cause the traveller to find easier, safer,
and more expeditious travelling, and the owners of horses a diminution
of nearly one-third of the original labour.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>John Loudon MᶜAdam</i>, Esq. called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>I believe, Mr. MᶜAdam, you reside at Bristol?—Yes,
I do.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>And have under your care a considerable district of the turnpike
roads in that neighbourhood?—Yes, about one hundred and
eighty miles of road in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>How long has your attention been particularly directed to the
state of the public roads of the kingdom generally, and the means
of their improvement?—About twenty-five years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you a professional civil engineer?—No.</p>

<p class='c007'>Be pleased to state to the Committee the general state of the
turnpike roads at the time you first directed your attention to
them, about twenty years ago?—I think the state of the roads
twenty years ago, was worse generally than at present, and in
particular places much worse. If the Committee would indulge
me, I would mention what first led me to these considerations.
On my first arriving from America in the year 1783, at the
time the roads were making in Scotland (their Turnpike Acts
being in operation about twenty years at that time,) very many
of their roads were unmade. I was then appointed a commissioner
of the roads, and had occasion in that capacity to see a
great deal of road-work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where?—In Scotland. This first led me to inquire into the
general method of road-making, and the expense of it. Since
that period, I have been mostly in Bristol, where I was also appointed
a commissioner of the roads; the very defective state of
which could not fail to attract my attention. I was induced to
offer myself to the commissioners, to take charge of the roads as
a surveyor, because I found it impossible for any individual
commissioner to get the roads put into a situation of being,
mended with any prospect of success; and no individual could
incur the expense of making experiments on a great scale. The
roads of Bristol were accordingly put under my direction in the
month of January 1816.</p>

<p class='c007'>That was when you were appointed surveyor?—Yes, I have
travelled at various times, during the lost twenty years, to
ascertain which are the best roads, and which the best means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>road-making over the whole kingdom, from Inverness in Scotland
to the Land’s End in Cornwall. I have obtained all the
information that an unauthorized person could expect to receive.
In the course of travelling through the country, I have generally
found the roads in a very defective state, certainly much worse
in particular parts of the country than in others; and in particular
counties I have found some parts of the roads much worse
than in other parts of the same county. The defects of the roads
appear to me to proceed from various causes, but principally
from the large use of a mixture of clay and chalk and other
matters, that imbibe water, and are affected by frost. Such
roads become loose in wet weather, so as to allow the wheels
of carriages to displace the materials, and thereby occasion the
roads to be rough and rutty. More pains, and much more expense,
have been bestowed on the roads of late years, but without, in
my opinion, producing any adequate effect, from want of skill in
the executive department. I consider the roads in South Wales,
in Monmouthshire, in Cornwall, in Devonshire, in Herefordshire,
in part of Hampshire, in part of Oxfordshire, and some
part of Gloucestershire, are managed with the least skill, and
consequently, at the heaviest expense. The paved roads of Lancashire
appear to be very unprofitable, and very expensive. I
shall mention to the Committee a few roads which I think in a
better condition and under a better system of management.
Eastward of Bridgewater in Somersetshire, near Kendal in
Westmoreland, and near North Allerton, in Yorkshire, the
roads appear to be in a much better state than in other parts of the
kingdom; and there is a striking difference in the moderate rate
of their tolls, which I have always found most moderate where
the roads are best managed. I consider the reason of the roads
in those parts being in a better condition than in other places, is
from greater skill and attention being paid to the preparation of
the materials and the manner laying them on the roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Does the superiority of roads, in certain places that you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>mentioned, arise from their better materials in those neighbourhoods?—No;
the same material is found in many parts of the
kingdom with much worse roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, in general, you impute the badness of the roads solely
to the applying of the materials?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>And also to the formation of the roads?—That I consider as
part of the application of the materials.</p>

<p class='c007'>Has there prevailed of late years a general spirit of improvement,
in different parts of the country, with regard to the roads?—I
think there has, and particularly in the west country.</p>

<p class='c007'>What instances have come within your own knowledge?—The
roads immediately round the city of Bristol to the extent of
148 miles, round Bath to the extent of 49 miles, between Cirencester
and Bath to the amount of 32 miles, the roads of nine
trusts in the eastern parts of Sussex amounting to 97 miles, at
Epsom in Surrey amounting to 20 miles, at Reading in Berkshire
six miles, amounting in the whole to 352 miles, have been
put into a very good condition; in addition to which, there are
now under repair, five trusts in Wiltshire and Berkshire, amounting
to 108 miles; six trusts in Middlesex, Cambridge and
Huntingdon, amounting to 91 miles; six trusts in Devonshire,
Buckinghamshire and Glamorganshire, amounting to 129 miles;
making a total of 328 miles under repair. These are roads that
have been mended, or are now mending, under directions which
I have given, or which have been given by my family.</p>

<p class='c007'>You are not particularly acquainted with the improvements
taking place under the management of other persons?—Not particularly;
but I have some knowledge of some of them from
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>You have not taken under observation the great road to
Holyhead?—No; that I understand is a new road. You asked
me with respect to the spirit of improvement; I would wish to
explain in what way I think that is proceeding. I have been
sent for and consulted by 34 different sets of commissioners, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>as many different trusts, and in 13 counties, to the extent of 637
miles, all of whom have been making improvements, and I have
had many sub-surveyors instructed and sent to various parts of
the country, at the request of commissioners; many surveyors
also in the neighbourhood where improvements are making,
have availed themselves of the opportunity of having instruction.
Thus the surveyors of Southampton and that neighbourhood have
attended to what is doing at Salisbury and Wilton; thus the surveyors
at Kingston and Guildford have profited by the improvements
at Epsom in Surrey.</p>

<p class='c007'>On which road are the 20 miles that you mentioned at Epsom?—From
Epsom to Tooting, and then across the country
to Kingston. Several surveyors near Reading in Berkshire have
imitated, with considerable success, the improvements on that
road. Mr. Clay, who has contracted for the repair of the
Kingsland road near London, engaged a young man who was
in my office at Bristol, Mr. Marshal, whom he sent afterwards
to Leeds in Yorkshire. It has been my study to give every
facility to spread information.</p>

<p class='c007'>Has your attention been directed to the roads in the neighbourhood
of London; and can you state to the Committee
whether any corresponding improvement has taken place in this
district?—I think less improvement has taken place round London
than in the country. On the new Surrey roads the example
set by the pieces of road made at Blackfriars and Westminster
bridges has induced a little amendment; the materials have been
more carefully broken, and they have continued to use the hammers,
rakes and other tools which were recommended to them;
but the general improvement is unimportant: and I am not aware
that any alteration has taken place in the system of expenditure,
and the mode of being supplied with materials, or in employing
more competent surveyors.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the experience you have had in the improvements that
have taken place, have you found that these have been attended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>generally, with an increase or diminution of expense?—In general
the expense must be diminished by the improvements. The
repairs of one hundred and forty-eight miles round Bristol, and
many expensive permanent improvements and alterations, have
been made in the last three years, during which a floating debt of
upwards 1,400<i>l.</i> has been paid off, a considerable reduction of
the principal debt has been made, and a balance of a considerable
amount is remaining in the hands of the treasurer, applicable
to further alterations, or to the payment of part of the debt,
at the discretion of the commissioners.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state what proportion that is?—I think the first
year, 723<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>What is the amount of the whole debt?—The whole debt is
43,000<i>l.</i> I said a considerable reduction of the principal debt
had been made, I did not use the word proportion. I can mention
that the balance in the hands of the treasurer, on the last
settlement of the account amounted to 2,790<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> in the
Bristol district, beside a considerable diminution of the debt, and
beside alterations and improvements.</p>

<p class='c007'>That applies only to one hundred and forty-eight miles round
Bristol?—Only to the one hundred and forty-eight miles round
Bristol. The Bristol district has been under one trust for twenty
years, and in that period the debt has increased to 43,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>You will be kind enough to furnish the Committee, with a
statement similar to that which was supplied by you to the
Holyhead Committee, down to the latest period?—I will.
Bristol is the only district for which I can have precise figures,
I have not had the finances in my own management or direction
with respect to the others. As I have only advised with respect to
them, I cannot give you the items; and I must say, that my information
with respect to other roads, must be much more general
than with respect to this road. In Sussex, the roads in nine
trusts have been mended with a considerable diminution of the
former expense, and the thanks of a general meeting of the trustees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>of the Lewes trusts were unanimously voted to Lord Chichester
“for the introduction of this system, by which the roads
had been so much improved, and the country was likely to
derive so much benefit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you found that a similar diminution of expense has
taken place where the materials have been bad, as where they
have been good?—Yes, I have.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you find your mode of management equally applicable
where the materials are bad as where they are good, and that
the same proportionable benefit arises?—I am afraid gentlemen
suppose that I have some particular mode of management, which
is certainly not the case, nor can by any means be the case; and in
every road I have been obliged to alter the mode of management,
according to the situation of the roads, and sometimes according
to the finances. At Epsom in Surrey, the roads have been
put into a good repair, at an expense considerably under the
former annual expenditure, by which the trustees have been
enabled to lower their tolls on agricultural carriages. The road
between Reading and Twyford, in Berkshire, has been made
solid and smooth since the beginning of July last, by persons
under my directions, at an expense, including the surveyor’s
salary, not exceeding fifteen pounds per week; and their former
expenditure, exclusive of the surveyor’s salary, was twenty-two
pounds per week. A great part of the road in the neighbourhood
of Bath, which was formed upon the plan laid down in
my report to the commissioners, and with the greatest success,
is made with freestone, which was always supposed impossible
to make a good road of; but it will make a good road. It
certainly does not last so long as one made of better materials;
but it is equally good whilst it does last. One of the roads out
of Bristol towards Old Down has been made good, where it
was a received opinion, that from the nature of the materials the
road could not be made so; and the commissioners would not
consent to my beginning it until the road was threatened to be
indicted. It was put into my hands in October 1816, and at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the Christmas following I was able to report that it was one of
the best roads in England for a distance of eleven miles, at the
expense of first outlay only of 600<i>l.</i> and it has continued so until
the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>Please to inform the Committee, what are the means, in your
opinion, the most eligible to be adopted for the amelioration of
the roads throughout the kingdom?—That question, I think,
divides itself into two branches: The operative part, in making
the roads, and the care of the finances, and the mode of their
expenditure. I should imagine the operative part of preparing
roads cannot be effected without procuring a more skilful set of
sub-surveyors; young men, brought up to agriculture and labour
must be sought, and regularly instructed. It is a business that
cannot be taught from books, but can only be acquired by a
laborious practice of several months, and actual work upon
roads, under skilful road-makers. Young men who have been
accustomed to agricultural labour are fittest to be made road-surveyors,
as their occupations have given them opportunities of
being acquainted with the value of labour both of men and
horses. But I should greatly mislead the Committee if I did
not inform them, that skill in the operative part of road-making
cannot alone produce a reformation of the multitude of abuses
that are practised in almost every part of the country, in the
management of roads and road funds. These abuses can only
be put down by officers in the situation of gentlemen, who must
enjoy the confidence, and have the support of commissioners, and
who must exercise a constant and vigilant inspection over the
expenditure made by the sub-surveyors. They must be enabled
to certify to the commissioners that the public money is judiciously
and usefully, as well as honestly expended; without this
control and superintendence an end cannot be put to the waste
of the public money, and all the various modes that are injurious
to the public interest, the amount of which would appear incredible,
could it be ascertained; but which, I conscientiously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>believe, amount to one-eighth of the road revenue of the kingdom
at large, and to a much greater proportion near
London.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you mean the frauds amount to one-eighth?—No, not
direct frauds, I call it mis-application; it must not be concealed,
that the temptations with which, even a superior officer will be
assailed, the facility of yielding to them, and the impunity with
which transgression may be committed, require great delicacy in
the selection of persons to fill the situation; and encouragement
to make this a profession must be in proportion to the quality of
the person required.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you not consider one of these mis-applications to be the
injudicious use of the labour of horses, instead of that of men,
women and children?—I do consider that to be a great mis-application
of the labour of horses. I am afraid that gentlemen
may understand, from what I said, that frauds are committed
to the amount of one-eighth, but I meant no such thing; I meant
the loss arising from mis-application generally. I have in general
found a great deal more materials put upon the road than are
necessary, and I am of opinion that is one of the chief causes
of the waste of the public money.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you think the loss arises, in most instances, from mistake,
or from any abuse in regard to the power and patronage which
the situation confers?—I think it proceeds from mistakes and
ignorance mostly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Please to explain to the Committee in what way you think the
labour of men, women and children, may be substituted for that
of horses?—I have generally found that a much greater quantity
of materials have been carted to the roads than are necessary,
and therefore the increase of horse-labour has been beyond any
useful purpose, and that generally the roads of the kingdom
contain a supply of materials sufficient for their use for several
years, if they were properly lifted and applied; this is to be
entirely done by men, women, and children, men lifting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>roads, and women and boys, and men past labour, breaking the
stones which were lifted up.</p>

<p class='c007'>By lifting the road, you mean turning it up with the pickaxe?—Yes;
that I consider as man’s work; taking up the
materials and breaking stones, I consider the work of women
and children, and which indeed ought to have been done before
those materials had been laid down.</p>

<p class='c007'>How deep do you go in lifting the roads?—That depends
upon circumstances, but I have generally gone four inches deep;
I take the materials up four inches deep, and having broken the
larger pieces, I put them back again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Please to explain to the Committee the mode of breaking the
stones so as to admit of the labour of men, women and children?—When
the stones of an old road have been taken up,
they are generally found of the size that women and boys can
break them with small hammers, and therefore I would propose
to employ these people to break those stones always before they
are laid back in the roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it your plan for those people to break those stones standing,
or in a sitting posture?—Always in a sitting posture:
because I have found that persons sitting will break more stones
than persons standing, and with a lighter hammer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Does that apply to all materials?—To all materials universally.</p>

<p class='c007'>Does the plan which you have mentioned of breaking up the
roads, apply to gravel roads, or only to those roads composed of
hard stones?—In gravel roads and in some other roads it would
be impossible to break them up to any advantage; and in several
places which I will explain, I should think it unprofitable to lift
a road at all. There is a discretion of the surveyor, or the
person who has the execution of the work, which must be exercised.
I did not order the road in the neighbourhood of
Reading to be lifted, but I directed wherever a large piece of
flint was seen, it should be taken up, broken, and put down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>again; and I directed the road to be made perfectly clean—I
am speaking of a gravel road now—and I directed that additional
gravel should be prepared in the pits by screening the dirt very
clean from it, breaking all the large pieces and bringing that
upon the road in very light coats not exceeding two inches at a
time; and when those coats were settled, to bring others of very
clean materials upon the road, until it settled into a solid smooth
hard surface, and which the coachmen in their mode of expression,
say “runs true.” The wheel runs hard upon it; it
runs upon the nail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Uninfluenced by the state of the weather?—Perfectly so.</p>

<p class='c007'>In your experience, have you observed that on gravel roads
the materials are generally very unskilfully and improperly
applied?—Generally so. I think always I may say, for I think
I never saw them skilfully or properly managed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you adopted the mode of washing the gravel?—No; I
think that is a more expensive process than is necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you think it more expensive than screening?—A great
deal more so, and I have another reason for objecting to that,
with respect to the gravel near London; the loam adheres so
strongly to it that no ordinary washing will clean it. The loam
is detached from the gravel by the united effort of the water
on the road, and the travelling, by which the roads near London
become so excessively dirty; but it would be impossible to detach
the loam from the gravel in the pits, by throwing water
on it; I have tried the experiment and know the fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>To what particular practice do you allude, when you inform
the Committee that gravel is unskilfully applied to the roads
in general?—I see that on gravel roads, the gravel is put on
after being very imperfectly sifted, and the huge pieces not being
broken, and the gravel is laid on the middle of the road and
allowed to find its own may to the sides. Now the principle of
road-making I think the most valuable, is to put broken stone
upon a road, which shall unite by its own angles, so as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>form a solid hard surface, and therefore it follows, that when
that material is laid upon the road, it must remain in the situation
in which it is placed without ever being moved again; and what
I find fault with putting quantities of gravel on the road is,
that before it becomes useful it must move its situation and be
in constant motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to attain the advantage you allude to in the angular
materials, I take it for granted, it is your plan to have the larger
pieces of gravel well broken?—Certainly; but I mean further,
that in digging the gravel near London, and places where there
are vast quantities of loam, and that loam adhering to every
particle of the gravel, however small, I should recommend to
leave the very small or fine part of the gravel in the pits, and to
make use of the larger part which can be broken, for the double
purpose of having the gravel laid on the road in an angular
shape, and that the operation of breaking it is the most effectual
operation for beating off the loam that adheres to the pieces of
gravel. There are other cases besides that of gravel, in which
I should think it unprofitable to lift a road. The road between
Cirencester and Bath is made of very soft stone, and is of so
brittle a nature, that if it were lifted it would rise in sand, and
there would be nothing to lay down again that would be useful.
I should not recommend lifting of freestone roads for the same
reason, because it would go so much to sand that there would
be very little to lay down again. I will explain what I have
done to that road between Cirencester and Bath; I was obliged
to lift a little of the sides of the road in order to give it shape,
but in the centre of the road, we, what our men call, “shaved
it;” it was before in the state which the country people call
“gridironed,” that is, it was in long ridges with long hollows
between, and we cut down the high part to a level with the
bottom of the furrows, and took the materials and sifted them at
the side of the read and returned what was useful to the
centre.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Can you state whether the plan adopted on this road has increased
or diminished the expense?—I think the expenses, by
the last account, were rather within the expenditure of the former
year, even including the new surveyor’s wages. They had been
in the practice of allowing about 32<i>l.</i> a week to the two surveyors
as the ordinary expenditure; I directed the new surveyors
not to exceed that sum upon any account whatever,
including their own wages: but formerly they paid that sum,
and paid the surveyor his wages at the end of the quarter or
half-year in addition: therefore I consider the sum expended
upon the road is rather within the former expenditure than
otherwise, except with regard to two dangerous slips which
took place at Swainswick-hill, which I consider as perfectly
extra.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the formation of roads under your management, to what
shape do you give the preference; I allude to the convex
shape or the flat?—I consider a road should be as flat as possible
with regard to allowing the water to run off at all, because
a carriage ought to stand upright in travelling as much as possible.
I have generally made roads three inches higher in the
centre than I have at the sides, when they are 18 feet wide;
if the road be smooth and well made, the water will run off very
easily in such a slope.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider a road so made will not be likely to wear
hollow in the middle, so as to allow the water to stand, after it
has been used for some time?—No; when a road is made
flat, people will not follow the middle of it as they do when it is
made extremely convex. Gentlemen will have observed that in
roads very convex, travellers generally follow the track in the
middle, which is the only place where a carriage can run upright,
by which means three furrows are made by the horses and the
wheels, and the water continually stands there: and I think that
more water actually stands upon a very convex road than on one
which is reasonably flat.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>What width would you in general recommend for laying
materials on a turnpike road?—That must depend upon the
situation. Near great towns roads of course ought to be wider
than farther in the country. Roads near great towns ought not
to be less than thirty or forty feet wide, but at a distance from
great towns it would be a waste of land to make them so
wide.</p>

<p class='c007'>You mean a breadth of thirty feet actual road?—Yes. The
access to Bristol for a distance of about three miles, if we had
room between the hedges, I would make about thirty feet wide.
Between Bath and Bristol I should wish to see the road wide
all the way, because it is only the distance of twelve miles between
two large cities.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what way do you make the watercourses at the sides of
the road; I ask that question, having observed the farmers, in
exercising their power of cleaning out their ditches, dig them to
such a depth as to render them dangerous to be passed at night?—I
always wished the ditch to be so dug as that the materials
of the road should be three or four inches above the level of the
water in the ditch, and to that point we endeavour to bring the
farmers, but they are very unwilling to clean the ditches at any
time when called upon, and when they do it, if they find vegetable
mould in any quantity at the bottom of the ditch, they will
prosecute their inquiry much deeper than is useful, or proper for
safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider you have power by law, at present, for
preventing that?—Yes; because the law says, they are to clean
them out according to the directions of the surveyors.</p>

<p class='c007'>In your experience have you found any impediment to the
improvement of the roads, from a want of power in the proprietors
of different navigations to lower their tolls for conveying
materials?—I have found in the river Lea navigation, that
the trustees have no power to lower their tolls, which were imposed
by act of parliament upon merchandize, and therefore, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>operated in a great measure as a prohibition to carry materials
upon that river.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider it would be to the interest of the proprietors
to allow materials to be carried on their navigations at
a lower rate than they are empowered to allow by law?—Yes,
if they could.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you know any similar instance as applicable to canals?—I
don’t know an instance with respect to canal trusts, but there
is an instance with respect to the Bath river at Bristol. No
mitigation of the present rate of duty on that river can take place
if objected to by any one proprietor, and therefore we have
found great difficulty in carrying materials on the Bath river.
In one particular place we have been entirely precluded from
carrying any.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you found any impediment to the improvement of roads
arising from the conditions upon which materials are permitted
to be conveyed from one parish to another?—Yes; I found that
in several cases in the Bristol district. One very strong instance
occurred near Keynsham; we had a quarry close to the edge of
one parish, and we could not carry the stones from it to the
distance of ten yards, without the process of going to the
magistrates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did you in that case make application to the magistrates?—I
did intend to make application, but before I made that application,
I found in the very next field, belonging to the same
farmer, and in the parish where we required them, the necessary
materials, and I was under the necessity of opening both the
fields, to the detriment of the farmer’s landlord I am persuaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you know an instance of such an application as that to
which you have alluded, having been made to the magistrates,
and having been refused?—No, I do not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you think that a great inconvenience and loss of time
would be saved if that necessity of application was dispensed
with?—It certainly is a great inconvenience, and creates a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>deal of heart-burning in the country, and much dispute. I think
the commissioners would very seldom be disposed to carry materials
from one parish to another, unless for the general public
good.</p>

<p class='c007'>What depth of solid materials would you think it right to put
upon a road, in order to repair it properly?—I should think that
ten inches of well consolidated materials is equal to carry anything.</p>

<p class='c007'>That is, provided the substratum is sound?—No; I should
not care whether the substratum was soft or hard; I should
rather prefer a soft one to a hard one.</p>

<p class='c007'>You don’t mean you would prefer a bog?—If it was not such
a bog as would not allow a man to walk over, I should prefer it.</p>

<p class='c007'>What advantage is derived from the substrata not being perfectly
solid?—I think, when a road ts placed upon a hard substance,
such as a rock, the road wears much sooner than when
placed on a soft substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>But must not the draught of a carriage be much greater on a
road which has a very soft foundation, than over one which is of
a rocky foundation?—I think the difference would be very little
indeed, because the yield of a good road on a soft foundation, is
not perceptible.</p>

<p class='c007'>To use the expression to which you have alluded, as being
used by the coachmen, would a carriage run so true upon a road,
the foundation of which was soft, as upon one of which the
foundation was hard?—If the road be very good, and very well
made, it will be so solid, and so hard, as to make no difference.
And I will give the Committee a strong instance of that, in the
knowledge of many gentlemen here. The road in Somersetshire,
between Bridgewater and Cross, is mostly over a morass,
which is so extremely soft, that when you ride in a carriage along
the road, you see the water tremble in the ditches on each side;
and after there has been a slight frost, the vibration of the
water from the carriage on the road, will be so great as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>break the young ice. That road is partly in the Bristol district.
I think there is about seven miles of it, and at the end of those
seven miles, we come directly on the limestone rock. I think
we have about five or six miles of this rocky road immediately
succeeding the morass; and being curious to know what the
wear was, I had a very exact account kept, not very lately, but
I think the difference is as five to seven in the expenditure of
the materials on the soft and hard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you mean seven on the hard and five on the soft?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>And yet the hard road is more open to the effect of the sun
and air than the soft road?—It certainly lies higher.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you ever inquired of the coachmen, on which of those
two descriptions of roads the carriages run the lightest?—Yes,
I have; and I have found that there is no difference, if the road
be equally smooth on the surface, whether it be placed on the
soft ground or hard.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in forming a road over a morass, would you bottom the
road with small or large stones?—I never use large stones on the
bottom of a road; I would not put a large stone in any part
of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In forming a road across morass, would you not put some sort
of intermediate material between the bog and the stone?—No,
never.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would you not put faggots?—No, no faggots.</p>

<p class='c007'>How small would you use the stones?—Not to exceed six
ounces in weight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you not found that a foundation of bog sinks?—No, not
a bit of the road sinks; and we have the same thickness of materials
on the one as on the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a road be made smooth and solid, it will be one mass, and
the effect of the substrata, whether clay or sand, can never be
felt in effect by carriages going over the road; because a road
well made, unites itself into a body like a piece of timber or a
board.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>In making a road under these circumstances, do you make the
whole of the depth of materials at once?—No, I prefer making
a road in three times.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three different times?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>To what size would you break the hard materials?—To the
size of six ounces weight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you not think that is an indefinite criterion; had you not
better mention the size?—No; I did imagine myself, that the
difference existed to which you allude, and I have weighed six
ounces of different substances, and am confident there is little
difference in appearance and none in effect; I think that none
ought to exceed six ounces; I hold six ounces to be the maximum
size. If you made the road, of all six ounce stones it
would be a rough road; but it is impossible but that the greater
part of the stones must be under that size.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you find a measure or ring through which the stones will
pass, a good method of regulating their size?—That is a very
good way, but I always make my surveyors carry a pair of scales
and a six ounce weight in their pocket, and when they come to
a heap of stones, they weigh one or two of the largest, and if
they are reasonably about that weight they will do; it is impossible
to make them come exactly to it. I would beg leave to
say, in all cases of laying new materials upon an old road, I recommend
loosening the surface with a pickaxe a very little, so
as to allow the new materials to unite with the old, otherwise
the new materials being laid on the hard surface never unite, but
get kicked about, and are lost to the roads; wherever new materials
are to be put down upon an old road, I recommend a
little loosening; but that I don’t call lifting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you stated what thickness of new materials you would
lay down on an old road?—I should consider an old road would
not want new materials if it had ten inches of materials before,
but I should only pick up the materials, and break the large
stones; and if there were any want of materials, I would lay on
as much as would bring it up to somewhere about the ten inches.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Would you prefer doing that in dry weather or in wet weather?—In
wet weather, always; I always prefer mending a road
in weather not very dry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you of opinion that any alteration of the present law,
either in regard to the repeal of the present regulations or the
enactment of new ones, could advantageously take place in regard
to the shape of wheels, and the allowance of weight to be
carried in waggons and carts?—I am of opinion that the descriptions
of wheels given in all the acts of parliament in the last
sessions are the most convenient and useful; and I have thought
of the matter very much, without being able to suggest any alteration
profitable to the public. With respect to weights, I consider
there are very great difficulties in that business. We have
weighing machines in the neighbourhood I now am in, and I am
persuaded in many instances that they are made instruments of
oppression, and in a great many cases the means of committing
very great fraud on the commissioners and others; and if some
method could be fallen upon by which weighing machines might
be dispensed with altogether, and the road reasonably protected,
I should think it a very great public advantage. In the new
Bristol Act, I have proposed to the commissioners that they
should submit to parliament to lay a toll-duty upon the number
of horses in a progressive ratio, so as to compel those people who
offend to bring in their hands the penalty in the shape of toll; I
think it would prevent a great deal of that system of entering
into combinations between the toll collectors and the waggoners,
which is carried on to a great extent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you think, that if horses in narrow-wheeled waggons
were obliged to draw otherwise than at length, it would afford
any protection to the road?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Has not the practice of making horses draw at length very
much a tendency to make the horses follow one track, be the
road ever so good?—Yes; and I must mention to the Committee,
that the feet of horses on ill-made roads do full as much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>mischief as the wheels. It is driving horses in a string that
makes a road what the country people call “gridironed;” it is
an odd expression, but it is a very significant one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you not believe, that if horses were attached to narrow
wheeled waggons in pairs, it would be found very considerably
easier to drive and guide them when abreast, than when placed
at length?—I should think it would.</p>

<p class='c007'>And would it not tend to prevent accidents?—Horses driven
in pairs would provide in a great measure against the accidents
that arise from the carelessness of those persons who drive them,
which is extremely great.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you think that if horses were put in pairs to waggons, the
power of holding back those waggons when going down a hill,
would be so much increased as to prevent the necessity of so
frequently locking the wheels?—Certainly it would; because on
certain slopes it would not be necessary to lock the wheels; but
there are very steep hills where you cannot do without locking.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is not locking wheels an operation extremely injurious to the
roads?—I am not prepared to say it is, if the drag-iron, as it is
called, be of a proper description. I followed a waggon lately,
with seven tons of timber on it, down Park-street, at Bristol,
being a very steep road, with both its hind wheels locked; and
this waggon, with this weight of timber on in and with both
the hind wheels locked, did not make the least impression from
the top of the street to the bottom. You could discern where
the drag-irons had gone, but they had not displaced the materials
nor done any mischief.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t you find locking generally injurious?—Extremely injurious;
on rough roads it is dreadful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would not fewer ruts be made if it were more the custom for
horses to draw in pairs?—I believe gentlemen are not generally
aware of what a rut consists. There are two kinds of ruts, generally
speaking: one is a rut produced by displacing ill-prepared
materials, and that is the common rut. When a road is made of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>ill-prepared materials, the wheel piles them up one upon another,
and that forms a very narrow rut, which just holds the wheel;
but a rut made by wear upon a smooth surface, is rather a concave
hollow than a rut, and will present no difficulty to a carriage
in travelling, and that is the difference between a rut produced
by wear in a very well-made road, and that produced by
displacing the materials.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is there not much injury done to the roads by the heavy weights
both of coaches and waggons?—I am not disposed to think that
upon a well-made road the weight of coaches is material, or that
it would be judicious to make any legal provisions affecting that
subject. In regard to waggons, I conceive that the loads carried
upon wheels of the description encouraged by recent acts of
parliament, whatever their weight, would be very little injurious
to well-made roads. I think a waggon wheel of six inches in
breadth, if standing fairly on the road with any weight whatever,
would do very little material injury to a road well made, and
perfectly smooth. The injury done to roads is by these immense
weights striking against materials, and in the present mode of
shaping the wheels they drive the materials before them, instead
of passing over them, because I think if a carriage passes fairly
over a smooth surface, that cannot hurt the road, but must rather
be an advantage to it, upon the principle of the roller.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you not of opinion that the immense weights carried by
the broad-wheeled waggons, even by their perpendicular pressure,
do injury by crushing the materials?—On a new-made road
the crush would do mischief, but on a consolidated old road the
mere perpendicular pressure does not do any. But there is a
great deal of injury done by the conical form of the broad wheels,
which operate like sledging instead of turning fairly. There is
a sixteen-inch wheel waggon which comes out of Bristol, that
does more injury to our roads than all the travelling of the day
besides.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you of opinion that any benefit arises from those broad-wheeled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>waggons, which would justify their total exemption
from tolls?—None at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Does the answer you have given to the Committee relative to
the effect of great weights, apply equally to roads made with
gravel, as well as broken stone?—I mean it to apply to all well-made
roads, whether of gravel or of other materials.</p>

<p class='c007'>You mean after the road is smooth and solid?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>But with regard to a new road, are you not of opinion that the
materials are crushed and worn out by a great weight?—Yes;
no doubt that is so on a new-made road, and one of those waggons
with the wheels made conical, would crush a greater proportion
of stone than it ought to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you not conceive that the state of the turnpike roads would
be improved by not allowing any waggons to carry more weight
than four ton?—I don’t know that that would make any great
difference, under good management. I think the defect lies in
a want of science in road-making.</p>

<h3 class='c003'><i>Martis, 9° die Martii, 1819.</i></h3>

<h4 class='c011'><i>John Loudon MᶜAdam</i>, Esquire, called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>In your evidence last week, you stated that less improvement
had taken place in the roads in the neighbourhood of London
than in any other district, to what causes do you attribute this
circumstance?—I consider the principal cause to be the small
extent of the trusts, and the peculiar situation of London, which
increases the bad effects of the division into very small trusts.</p>

<p class='c007'>What are the particulars of the situation to which you allude?—The
situation of most of the roads near London is very low,
difficult to be kept free from water, the traffic is very great both
in weight and number, and therefore requiring more skill, as
well as more care and attention, than the other roads of the kingdom;
the material found near London for making the roads is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>gravel of a very bad quality, it is mixed with an adhesive loam
that cannot be separated from the gravel, except by the united
power of water and friction; this operation cannot be effectually
performed before laying it on the roads, but is done by the rain
and the traffic, producing a stiff mud, which is not only in itself
an impediment to travelling, but has the effect of keeping the
roads loose; the form of the gravel is also unfavorable, being
smooth round masses of flint, without any angles by which the
parts might unite. On the other hand, London is placed in a
situation peculiarly convenient for being supplied with materials
from a distance, by water carriage. The materials that may be
so procured are of the very best description, and, under the
sanction of parliament, may be procured on very moderate terms.
The Thames furnishes gravel of a very good quality and quite
clean; by using this gravel, the navigation of the river will be
improved; the several canals, the Surrey, the Grand Junction,
Paddington, and river Lea navigation, present facilities for procuring
clean flint of the best kind; the coast of Essex, Kent,
and Sussex, can furnish a supply to any extent of beach pebbles,
one of the best road materials in the kingdom. Granite chippings
might be obtained occasionally from Cornwall, Guernsey and
Scotland, as ballast; two pieces of road were made with these
materials near London, without any mixture of land gravel, at
Blackfriars Bridge and Westminster Bridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>What are the impediments which, in your opinion, prevent
the commissioners of the roads near London from availing themselves
of those advantages?—The very small trusts into which
the roads in the immediate vicinity of London are divided, is the
principal cause; this renders it impossible for commissioners to
enter upon the plan of procuring materials upon an extended
scale, and they cannot be obtained with any regard to economy,
except in quantity, with a view to a supply for the whole roads,
proceeding from the stones of London to a certain distance.
There are also some impediments arising from particular laws,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>regulations and customs, which can only be removed by parliament.
The Ballast Act gives a right of pre-emption to the
Trinity House of all stone and other materials brought as ballast
into the Thames. The coasting duty on stone operates as a prohibition
to the importation of stone as merchandize; the amount
of canal duties payable on merchandize prevents the carriage of
road materials on all inland navigations; manure so transported
has been protected in most Canal Acts, but road materials have
not been considered. Should parliament be pleased to remove
these difficulties, the London roads may be rendered independent
of the gravel of the country, by a moderate exertion of statistical
and mercantile information on the part of the officers employed
by the commissioners.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the Committee understand you right, you give a decided
preference to materials thus imported, over the gravel to be found
in the neighbourhood of London?—I do.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it your opinion, that by proper regulations a sufficient supply
of those materials to which you have alluded, could be procured
for the whole of the roads in the neighbourhood of London?—Yes,
I think there might; because a steady and constant demand,
even at a low price, would insure importation, and this demand
can only be steady if the roads round London were consolidated
under one set of commissioners acting for the whole, and having
depôts into which they could receive materials at all times at a
fixed price, to be distributed wherever wanted, by an assurance of
a ready purchaser; vessels coming in ballast, or not fully loaded,
from any place where good road materials were to be procured,
would be induced to take on board sufficient to make up their
loading; contracts could also be made for flint by the various
canals, and upon terms more moderate than the present price of
gravel; I am unable to lay before the Committee a detailed plan
for supplying the London roads with good and cheap materials,
which requires a considerable time and attention in the inquiry.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Is there any other information connected with the improvement
of the roads in the neighbourhood of London, which you think
you could give to the Committee?—I am quite satisfied that the
materials to be imported into London would make good roads,
because I made two pieces of very excellent road with those materials
at the two bridges, without making use of any gravel of
the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>At what time was this done?—The pieces of road were made
in August and September 1817.</p>

<p class='c007'>What was the extent?—There were about 200 yards of the
one, and about 180 yards of the other; one of them joins the
iron pavement at the foot of Blackfriars bridge; and the other
joins the Marsh-gate turnpike, and goes to the Asylum; those
roads were made with river-gravel and pebbles from the coast.</p>

<p class='c007'>From whence did you get the river-gravel?—It was purchased
from the steam-engines that raise it in the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did you lift the old road?—I took up all the stones that were
in them that were good for any thing, the flints and other stones,
and then made use of a considerable quantity of additional materials
to make the surface of the road afterwards.</p>

<p class='c007'>Was the expense considerable?—There was no account kept
of the expense of the experiment at Westminster bridge, because
the commissioners wished me to employ a number of paupers and
persons that had been on the road before, without discharging
them, who were very indifferent hands; and they also wished
that the road should be very considerably above the level than I
thought necessary, and that brought much more materials than
otherwise need have been put on; but the Blackfriars bridge
experiment cost about seven-pence halfpenny per square yard;
there was a very correct account kept of it, including the price of
materials and labour, and every thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Could you state what that would amount to for a mile?—That
would depend upon the breadth of the road.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>At what rate per mile would be the expense of such an improvement,
supposing the road thirty feet wide?—About 528l.
or 530<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Is not a road constructed with a roadway of sixteen feet
breadth of solid materials, and with six feet on each side of that
with slighter materials, a sufficient road for the general purposes
of country travelling?—Yes; and generally the roads round
Bristol are made with stone, about the breadth of sixteen feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>In your former answer respecting materials, you made use generally
of the term roads “round London,” to what extent did
you mean to convey the idea of that improvement?—I should
think that the river, and the facility of the canals, might in all
places allow you to carry the improvement ten miles round London;
and perhaps where the canals or rail-ways come through
the country, you might carry the improvement farther.</p>

<p class='c007'>Has not the system of road management at present practised,
the effect of repressing efforts for acquiring skill and exertions of
science, as connected with the business of road-making?—I
think it has.</p>

<p class='c007'>Will you explain in what way?—Because the surveyors at present
appointed are not required to have any particular skill in their
business before they are appointed; but the appointment generally
takes place to provide for some person a situation; and the want
of superior officers over the sub-surveyors is the means of preventing
those sub-surveyors from acquiring a knowledge necessary to
execute their duties under an officer who would know whether
they were able to execute them or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>You mean that there is a not a sufficient degree of inspection
and control provided by the legislature over the conduct of the
surveyor of the roads?—I think so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you conceive that a more scientific system of management
of roads is wanted universally?—I do.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not you conceive that the want of this scientific system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>leads to a great waste of public money?—I think it leads to a
great waste of public money.</p>

<p class='c007'>And also to a great waste of property in horses and carriages?—I
think it does.</p>

<p class='c007'>Has any estimate ever been made of the extent of that loss?—There
can be no accurate estimate of a loss so universal as that
of the waste of horses and carriages by bad roads; but the Committee
of 1811 estimated the saving which would be made to
the country by putting the roads in a proper state of repair, at a
sum equal to five millions annually.</p>

<p class='c007'>What remedy would you propose to cure the defects of
the general system of road management?—My opinion is, that
the only cure would be to have people of a better station of life
placed over them in the direction of this business; that each
county or large district in the country ought to have an officer
in the character of a gentleman, to oversee the surveyors of the
district; not only to direct them what to do, but to see that the
work is judiciously and honestly executed; and I think a very
small proportion of the sum now wasted by bad management
would pay for such an establishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would you alter the trusts?—That would be a great advantage,
if the trusts could be consolidated; but there are objections to
that, and very serious objections.</p>

<p class='c007'>Local objections?—Yes, such as the debt upon each trust.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you propose the appointment of those overseers to be with
the present commissioners of the roads?—Certainly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you propose any general inspection to be established over
the whole system of road-making?—I should think it a public
advantage if there was some inspection or controlling power in
some quarter or other, to prevent the general surveyors from
being improperly appointed; but whether that controlling power
should emanate from the government, or the authorities in the
county, I am not a judge.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Do you think a controlling power established in the metropolis,
to communicate on the subject throughout the kingdom,
would be an advantageous establishment?—I think it would be a
very profitable and desirable establishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking to the revenues and to practical advantages?—Looking
to the revenues, practical advantages, and to the dissemination
of information.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would you propose their having a power of suspending officers
in certain cases?—Certainly, till the pleasure of the commissioners
was known; on any gross instance of misconduct or
negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would not you propose they should report occasionally the
state and condition of the roads, and also the state of the finances
of each trust?—I should think the state of the finances ought
to be reported in some way every year, that they might reach
parliament, either by counties, or by some means the least expensive
and least troublesome; and I think such a report of the
finances, annually, would be a great means of preventing mis-application
of the public funds; and it would create a comparison
between one part of the country and another, that would be
useful in checking misconduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then you do not think there is, at present, a sufficient protection
of the road revenue of the kingdom against dishonest or
ignorant practices?—I think the road revenue is less protected
than any other part of the public expenditure; and, though it is
very large, it may be considered, I think, almost unprotected,
under the present system of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you any loose guess in your own mind, as to the extent
of the revenue throughout the kingdom, raised for the purpose
of maintaining roads?—I have been led to guess a million and a
quarter a year, as the toll revenue; from the circumstance of
there being five-and-twenty thousand miles of turnpike road in
England and Wales.</p>

<p class='c007'>That is an increasing revenue?—It is certainly increasing very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>much; I think the revenue has been increased by the increase of
travelling, and particularly stage-coaches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Has not it been the practice to augment the tolls considerably
in all recent turnpike acts?—In the three sessions of parliament
preceding the present, I think, there were about ninety petitions
to parliament for a renewal of acts, and an increase of their tolls,
because they were in a state that they could not pay their debts
without the assistance of parliament.</p>

<p class='c007'>Does not the great expense attending the renewal of acts of
parliament, contribute very much to restrain a proper improvement
of the roads in the kingdom?—The expense of renewing
so many acts of parliament, as is occasioned by the great division
of trusts in the country, certainly absorbs a very great sum of the
road revenue of the kingdom; because those acts are every one
of them renewed every twenty-one years, and frequently circumstances
oblige the trustees to come oftener to parliament.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you happen to know whether there have been any steps taken
by the Post-office, with a view to forming some general arrangement
with regard to the roads?—I am not acquainted with any.
I have had repeated conversations with lord Chichester, the
postmaster-general, and he has asked for all the information I
could give his lordship; and, of course, I have given the information
pretty much in the manner I have had the honour to
do to this Committee; and, I believe, his lordship is satisfied,
that the consolidation of trusts would be very useful: and he has
used his influence in the county of Sussex to have nine trusts
consolidated, for the express purpose of mutual assistance in
providing a general surveyor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you know the result?—I gave the result, and a copy of
the resolutions of the county, at the last meeting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you know the result as to the expenditure?—Yes, it goes
to that as well as to the amendment of the roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Supposing any insuperable difficulty to exist in placing the
management of the roads of the kingdom under a board of management,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>do you not consider that very great advantage would
arise from consolidating the different trusts round London, and
placing them under an unity of superintendence and regulation?—Certainly
so; I think that that would be a measure of the greatest
use in the world; and I think that no palliative, no other
means whatever can be devised to get the London roads improved,
except consolidating the trusts under one head, or one set of
commissioners, or some body that shall control the whole; consolidating
the roads round London, would be the means probably
of great amelioration in the system or manner of mending the
roads, and that would serve as an example to other parts of the
country, and might be the means of extending improvement in
the mode of road-making, and would form a sort of school or
example to other parts of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you think, upon the same principle that you recommend
consolidating trusts round London, it would be advisable that
powers should be given to consolidate trusts in different parts of
the kingdom?—I should think it very advisable that powers were
granted by parliament to such trusts as chose to do it, to consolidate
themselves into one body for the purpose of having a better
superintendence, or for any other purposes of general improvement;
but upon considering the matter very fully, I am of opinion
that it would be more profitable that the Legislature should
give leave to trusts than that they should make it imperative upon
them; it will be absolutely necessary, before any such measure
could come into effect, that parliament should not only give this
leave, but that they should make the proceedings of the general
meeting of those trusts legal, which at present they would not be
as the law stands; the nine trusts in Sussex, who have now
voluntarily associated together, hold what is considered a general
meeting of those trusts; but I by no means think that their proceedings
are legal, as the law now stands.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many cases where the consolidation would be beneficial,
do not you consider it would be resisted from local motives?—Perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>it might be resisted; it will be unfortunate when that
happens to be the case, but when the good effects of it begin to
be seen in the country, I think those objections would be got
rid of.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you believe that the first effects of such consolidation would
be a diminution of expense?—I am quite certain of that.</p>

<p class='c007'>How is that diminution of expense to arise?—By introducing
a much better mode of management, it would occasion more
regularity in the mode of keeping accounts, it would introduce
a diminution of expense materially in horse labour, and in various
other things; that I think, upon the whole, the diminution of
expense by such regulation would be found very great indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not you believe that the present system of maintaining roads
is the means of a continued increase of expense in the debt and
tolls throughout the kingdom?—I think the debt is increasing
very much throughout the kingdom and that the debt is perhaps
greater than gentlemen in parliament are aware of; at present tolls
are increasing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider that there is a corresponding improvement in
the roads, in proportion to the increase of the tolls and debts?—By
no means; my belief is, that where the greatest expense is,
there the worst management is, or rather, that the worst management
produces the greatest expense.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, in your opinion, a great improvement might be effected
on the roads in general, which might be accompanied in the end
by a gradual diminution of debt and tolls?—Certainly, I think
so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you give any information as to the total amount of general
debt on the roads now existing in England and Wales?
After inquiring by all the means that an unauthorized individual
could do in different parts of the country, and ascertaining, as
nearly as I could, the amount of debt upon a great number of
trusts; I have been inclined to believe that the debt at present
amounts to about seven millions in England and Wales.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Are you of opinion that any considerable advantage might be
derived in the management of the roads, by a commutation for
the statute labour?—Yes; I think very great advantage would
be derived by the public, if the statute labour were commuted
for money, and that, if it were commuted at a very low rate;
if it were one half of the real value of the work, I should think,
the roads would be more benefited by it in general through the
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it the general practice in Scotland, under any act of parliament,
to commute statute labour for money?—All the acts of
parliament I am acquainted with in Scotland, have commuted it;
one in the county I belong to, commuted it twenty years ago
with very great advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>You have mentioned that the commissioners of the Westminster
bridge road required you to employ a considerable number of
paupers; the Committee wish to know whether it is the general
practice, in your observation, to employ paupers upon roads?—I
have always found that in every place where the improvement of
the roads has been commenced, under any advice given by me,
it has been desired very much by the inhabitants that the people
unemployed (not, perhaps, paupers that generally receive parish
relief, but those people who come to ask for relief, because they
cannot get work) should be employed on the road; and it has
been very much my wish to gratify that desire by giving them
work, not by the day, but by the piece, because that has generally
put them off the parishes; the moment they get work to
do, by which they can get their bread, and without which they
cannot get their bread, they quit the parish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it not the practice, in trusts where you have not been concerned,
to employ paupers, or very old labourers?—I have
found in all the trusts that have sent to me to take advice, that
the labourers have been a great number of them very inefficient
men; and the excuse generally given for that is, that those people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>would come to the parish if they were not sent to the
roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is the pay of those men proportionably low with their abilities
to work?—I have not found that to be the case. I have found
that those poor, miserable men, who can do very little, have
been getting considerable wages, and in that way a considerable
sum has been wasted.</p>

<p class='c007'>In point of practice, then, the road revenue is made to act as
a poor fund?—Precisely so; I think the road revenue has gone
to the assistance of the poor in that way.</p>

<p class='c007'>In your experience have you found that the common mode of
employing paupers by day-work, is inefficient both to the improvement
of the roads and to the object of relieving the parishes?—It
may have the effect of relieving the parishes, but I should
think it a very bad mode of mending the roads; inasmuch as
these men, when they have got day-wages, will do very little,
and for that reason I employ all our men on piece-work; we have
two hundred and eighty labourers in the district of Bristol, and
they are almost all on piece-work; it is very seldom we employ
men by the day. I was directed by the Committee, at their last
meeting, to produce some more detailed accounts respecting the
Bristol district: in obedience to that order, I have obtained
the report made by me at the end of the first and second year of
my administration, which I beg to submit to the Committee, together
with the resolution of the commissioners thereon.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Bristol Turnpikes.</span><br /> Report of Mr. John Loudon MᶜAdam, to a General Meeting of Commissioners, 2d June 1817.</h4>

<p class='c012'>Since I had the honour of reporting to the meeting of commissioners
on the 2d of March last, the amendment of the roads
has proceeded with success, and at present there are no parts of
the roads of the Bristol district in a bad state.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much has been done in partial improvements, which have altogether
amounted to a considerable sum, although not of sufficient
magnitude individually to come within the scope of the
regulations of the general meeting, that restrain improvements
exceeding 50<i>l.</i> without special order; several such improvements
are still necessary, and some of the small bridges require to
be lengthened in the arches, in order to lead the roads to them
more commodiously, and to widen the roadway on the bridges.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statement of the income and expenditure of the year, now
made up to the 25th March, presents a very satisfactory result.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>In the last year, a sum equal to nearly five times that of the
preceding year, has been paid into the 5 per cent. fund.</p>

<p class='c007'>A floating debt, which did not appear in the printed annual
account of last year, but which amounted to about 1,400<i>l.</i> has
been paid off.</p>

<p class='c007'>The balances of treasurer’s accounts, which last year showed
the trust to be indebted on the whole to the treasurer 356<i>l.</i> are
now so much on the other side, that your treasurers have on the
whole account a balance in hand of 614<i>l.</i> and this balance is
efficient, because the floating debt is now reduced to the
smallest sum possible, under the circumstances of a business so
extended.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to which, I have to congratulate the commissioners
on a reduction of the principal debt in the sum of 729<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
and that turnpike tickets, which were at a discount, are now in
demand at par.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since I had the honour to report to the commissioners, in June
1817, the business of the roads has gone on successfully, and
they have been kept in invariably good repair under the present

tried by all vicissitudes of the most unfavourable seasons ever
known.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several valuable improvements have also been effected in different
parts of the district; the very promising state of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>finances having induced the commissioners to employ great part
of the savings of their income for that purpose, instead of applying
the whole to the liquidation of the principal debt of the
trust. This great debt has, however, been diminished nearly
500<i>l.</i> while the sum expended on the permanent improvements
considerably exceeds 1,500<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>It is very gratifying to report to the commissioners this material
amelioration of the funds during the present year, when the
income of the trust has suffered a diminution of 425<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> occasioned
probably by the depression of trade throughout the
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be regretted that the directions of the general meetings
respecting the payments to the 5 per cent. fund have not been
more punctually obeyed; but without entering into the circumstances
of heavy debt and other difficulties, which have hitherto
prevented payments from particular treasurers, I beg leave to call
the attention of the commissioners to a consideration of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>importance of this fund, and the use to which it may be most
advantageously applied.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fund was instituted for the purpose of giving the general
meetings the power of extending aid to any division of the
roads of the district that might be in distress. As the favourable
state of the funds, arising from the system of management
adopted by the commissioners, gives a very reasonable hope that
such occasion of distress may never again occur, it may be expedient
to consider of the propriety of converting the 5 per
cents. into a sinking fund.</p>

<p class='c007'>By application of such a sum, amounting to about 850<i>l.</i>
annually, to the gradual extinction of the debt of the trust, the
means of continuing several useful and very desirable improvements
will be diminished only in a small proportion, and the
amendment of the general state of the roads will proceed,
without entirely losing sight of the justice due to the creditors,
and the desirable object of reducing a debt of such magnitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>As it may be doubtful whether under the authority of the
present act of parliament the trustees may legally apply the 5 per
cent. fund to the purpose of a sinking fund, the committee appointed
to prepare the new act may be instructed to consider of
this subject, and also for better securing the due payment of the
5 per cent. fund at stated periods, along with the interest of the
debt, to the general treasurer.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have great pleasure in being able to continue to give a favourable
report of the conduct of the sub-surveyors.</p>

upon me to say; but that increase of revenue must be deducted
from the saving of 2,700<i>l.</i>, which appears in the treasurer’s

evidence respecting the carrying a road over a morass in
Somersetshire, and the proportions of the materials used
upon that, and the part of the road with a rocky foundation,
which I stated from memory, I thought it proper to write
down to the treasurer of that road, to request the favour of
him to send for the surveyor, and know the facts exactly
from him. The treasurer, Mr. Phippen, who is a magistrate,
sent a certificate, signed by the surveyor. There was a
certificate, also, signed by Mr. Phippen; and with it there
was a letter from Mr. Phippen, of explanation; both of which
I wish to put in.</p>

stones laid at the foundation when the road was first made
more than fifty years since, lifted and beaten very small. The
general strength of the road is from seven inches to nine;
and five tons of stones, I have always considered for the repairs
of this part of the road equal to seven on the other
part over the hills.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There cannot, in my opinion, be any necessity to lay
the foundation of a road on any ground, even the most soft
and peaty, with large stones; daily observation tells me,
that this is a great waste of time, materials, and money.
I have had, for these five or six years past, a great deal of
experience in seeing roads made, one in particular, over a
very soft peat bog, by Wedmore and Glastonbury, in this
county. At the time this new line of road was proposed to
be made, a great difference of opinion existed as to its practicability,
and the method to be pursued to accomplish it.
Some of the parties were for laying the whole of the road
over the bog with brush-wood, on which were to be put
large flat stones, and on those smaller ones. We who were
the other party, insisted that a more simple, less expensive,
and more permanent method was to make it with stones
alone, broken very small. We, at last, prevailed, and the
system succeeded even beyond our most sanguine expectations;
for this part of the road has stood uncommonly well,
though the travelling on it has been very great, and with
heavy carriages, and the little repairs wanted have been done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>as an inconsiderable expense, compared to the other part of
the road made on hard ground over the hills.</p>

<p class='c007'>I wish, in reference to the opinion I gave with respect to
the statute labour, to state, that I have to transact with
sixty-nine parishes, respecting their statute labour, in the
counties of Somerset and Gloucester; and that it is in consequence
of these transactions, I gave the opinion to the
Committee that I had the honour to submit.</p>

<p class='c007'>What proportion of the statute duty, by pecuniary payments,
instead of the mode at present adopted, do you
conceive might be saved?—I think, if one third of the
present nominal value of the statute labour was to be regularly
paid into the hands of the treasurer, that it would be
more available to the public roads, than the present manner
in which the work is done, and certainly less onerous to the
agriculture of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon what roads have you been employed?—Upon the
Epsom and Ewell turnpike roads of twenty-one miles; upon
the Reading road of six miles; upon the eastern division of
the Egham road, seven miles and a half; on the western division
of the Egham road, eight miles and a half; on the Cheshunt

twenty-five miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>How long have you been appointed to them?—My first
appointment was in December 1817.</p>

<p class='c007'>Had you been previously in the habits of making the improvement
of turnpike roads your study?—I had at Bristol,
under my father’s tuition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The information you have acquired, I presume, then, has
been entirely under your father’s system?—Yes, upon my
father’s principles of making roads.</p>

conformable to the evidence which he has given before
this Committee?—Entirely conformable to those principles
which my father has stated in his evidence before this Committee.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you give the Committee any information with regard
to the revenues of the different roads under your management?—The
gross revenue of the trusts I have mentioned,
of which I am general surveyor, is about 19,550<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Please to state to the Committee, the state of repair in
which these roads were when they first came under your
management?—The roads in general were in a very loose,
rough, and heavy state, much overloaded with materials, the
watercourses much stopped up, and the roads in general in
a very bad state.</p>

<p class='c007'>What improvements have taken place upon them since
your undertaking the care of them?—The Epsom and
Ewell roads were put into a perfect state of repair during the
last spring and summer; the Reading road has also been put
into a perfect state of repair during the last summer; and
the Cheshunt turnpike roads have been put into a good state
of repair, notwithstanding that the improvements commenced
in October, and have been carried on through the whole
winter: the improvement is proceeding rapidly in the other
districts; but the three roads I have mentioned, are the only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>trusts that are brought into a perfect state of repair. I venture
to speak freely and with great confidence, of the good
state of repair of these three trusts; for the reason, that no
credit whatever is attached to me, except what may be considered
due by the careful attention and zealous execution of
my father’s commands. The merits of the improvements are
wholly his own.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state to the Committee the expense with which
these improvements have been accompanied?—The expense
upon the Epsom roads amounted to 1,929<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> in the
year 1818; that is the only trust upon which I am enabled
to state the twelvemonth’s expenditure.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what proportion has the expenditure been divided between
the labour of men, women, and children, and the
price of cartage and of materials?—I have paid for labour
upon the Epsom roads, 1,146<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>; for materials,
98<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>; for cartage, 227<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i>; for tradesmen’s bills,
342<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>; for land to widen the roads, 115<i>l.</i>; which
makes up the expenditure 1,929<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> I beg here to
state, that I did not avail myself of any statute duty upon
the Epsom and Ewell roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state to the Committee the expenditure upon
these roads, in the years preceding your having the charge
of them?—I can; in the years 1815, 1816, and, 1817,
which are the three preceding years to my having the charge
of these roads. In the year 1815, there was paid for
labour, 379<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i>; for cartage, 1,019<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i>; for gravel,
486<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>; for tradesmen’s bills, 178<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; making
a total of 2,064<i>l.</i> 9<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> In the year 1816, there was paid
for labour 340<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i>; for cartage, 1,070<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; for gravel,
563<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>; for tradesmen’s bills, 382<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> making
a total of 2,375<i>l.</i> 19<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> In the year 1817, there was paid
for labour, 339<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i>; for cartage, 1,103<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; for
gravel, 551<i>l.</i>; for tradesmen’s bills, 681<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>; making a
total of 2,675<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; independent of the statute duty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>upon the several parishes, which were called forth by the
former surveyor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you know the value of that statute duty?—Not having
had occasion to call it forth, I am unable precisely to answer
the question; but the parishes are wealthy, and the
statute labour must form a very considerable amount.</p>

<p class='c007'>I presume the comparative smallness of the expense which
you incurred for materials must have arisen from making use
of the old materials upon the road, by lifting them according
to the plan which your father has described?—That was the
case.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what state did you find the executive department of
these roads when you took charge of them?—I found at
Epsom a person as surveyor, who had been an underwriter
at Lloyd’s Coffee-house, at a salary, as I am informed, of
sixty pounds per annum, and who was permitted to keep the
carts and horses, and do the cartage for the trust. At
Reading, I found an elderly gentleman as the surveyor, who
was also one of the commissioners, at a salary of twenty
or thirty pounds per annum. I found at Cheshunt three
surveyors, the trust being divided into three districts.
One of the surveyors was an infirm old man, another a carpenter,
and another a coal-merchant. I found on the
Wades-mill trust three surveyors also, and the trust divided
into three districts; one of these surveyors was a very old
man, another a publican at Buckland, and the other a baker
at Backway, with a salary of fourteen shillings a week each.
I found on the Royston road a publican as surveyor there;
and I found at Huntingdon a bedridden old man who had
not been out of the house for several months, and who had
been allowed by the commissioners to apply to a carpenter
in the town for assistance, and to whom the commissioners
allowed twenty pounds per annum; this person, who
accompanied me in the survey of the roads, stated, that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>could give but little attention to the management of the road,
the salary being so small; and the state of those roads bore
evidence to the truth of his assertion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without entering into individual cases, do you consider
that it was possible, from the nature of the circumstances
and engagements of these parties, that they could give that
attention to the roads which their improvement required?—I
do not consider it was at all likely that they would.</p>

<p class='c007'>What arrangements did you make in the executive department
of these roads after you took the charge of them?—With
the permission of the trustees, I appointed upon each
trust an active sub-surveyor, whom I required to keep a
horse, and to have no other occupation whatever.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state to the Committee the expense of employing
such sub-surveyors?—The salary of the sub-surveyors in
general is one hundred guineas a year; and where the revenues
of the trust have been small, as in the case of the
Royston roads and the Huntingdon roads, I have made one
surveyor do the duty of both the trusts, in order that that
expense might be divided.</p>

<p class='c007'>What emoluments have you yourself derived from your
employment upon these trusts?—I am unable to state the
precise amount to the Committee; for the reason that I have
in every instance requested of the trustees that that consideration
might be deferred for at least a twelvemonth after
I was honoured with the charge of the roads; Epsom is
therefore the only road upon which that period has elapsed;
and with the permission of the Committee, I will read the
resolution entered upon the ledger of the Epsom roads upon
that subject.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>With permission of the Committee I will relate what I
stated to the trustees, upon those resolutions being read to
me; that I considered that sum as extremely liberal, and
quite sufficient for one small trust to give a general surveyor,
and were Epsom one trust in a district, such a sum
would be quite sufficient for their proportion of the salary of
a general surveyor; but standing alone, and divided from all
other trusts of which I had the management, and separated
also by the London roads, the necessity of my father’s travelling
from Bristol and residing some time at Epsom, and
of so much being required to be done the first year in a new
trust, that sum did no more than repay the actual expenses
incurred. It will be obvious to the Committee that such a
trust as Reading, consisting of six miles only, distant from
Bristol eighty miles, and from London forty miles, and
anticipating an equal liberality on the part of the commissioners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>there, no sum such a trust could be justified in giving
to a general surveyor could repay even a moiety of the expense
of superintendance; the reward for my services, then,
must be looked for in the convincing proof that my father’s
principles of road-making are, if possible, more applicable,
and more beneficial in a trust where the materials are very
bad than where they are good: my only object in troubling
the Committee with these observations, is to show that unless
a district of roads are united, the expense of a general
superintendence would not be paid by any salary such trust
could be justified in giving.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state to the Committee the nature of the materials
which you have employed in the different roads under your
care?—At Epsom there are flints; at Reading a very small,
foul gravel, with a thick adhesive loam attached; at Waltham
Cross, on the Cheshunt roads, small foul gravel; towards
Ware, flints; on the Wades-mill trust, flints; on the
Royston trust, flint, gravel, and blue permet stone; at
Huntingdon, flint, and gravel; Egham, flint and gravel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is there any particular method which you have employed
out of the common practice, for making use of these materials?—I
have bestowed great labour, care and attention in
the preparation of these materials in the pits, and in their
separation previous to their being brought upon the roads;
and also much labour and care for a length of time after their
being laid upon the road, until it became perfectly smooth,
hard and level.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state to the Committee the probable future expense
of keeping these roads in repair, after they have once
been put into good order, as compared with the annual outgoings
under the old management?—I am of opinion that
the expense of maintaining these roads in good condition
will be considerably less than the former expenditure; for
the reason, that the better a road is, the less the wear; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>that there will be a less quantity of materials required, when
properly prepared, than were formerly used, when they
were brought to the road in a very foul and improper state.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state generally, whether the proportion of labour,
materials and cartage that you have described upon the
Epsom trust, agrees with the same proportion upon the
other roads under your management?—On some of the
other roads, the proportion of labour to cartage will be
found greater than upon the Epsom road. At Cheshunt, in
five months, during which the roads have been put into
good repair, I have expended the sum of 800<i>l.</i> forty of
which alone was paid for cartage. Upon the Wades-mill
trust, out of 600<i>l.</i> expended, not a sixpence was paid for
cartage. Upon the Royston roads, where I have spent 500<i>l.</i>
not any of it was paid for cartage. Upon the Huntingdon
roads, I have spent 20<i>l.</i> a week, the whole of which has been
paid in labour. At Reading, during eight months, 500<i>l.</i>
were laid out, 400<i>l.</i> of which were paid for labour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it your opinion, that the proportion of labour, wages,
and cartage, is likely to continue the same, in the future
reparation of the roads?—I am of opinion they will; because
there will be an increase of labour, in the preparation of the
materials, previous to their being brought to the road; and
also in the formation of the road after they are laid on. By
a more careful and proper preparation of the materials, a
much less quantity will be required to uphold the roads than
formerly; I am, therefore, of opinion, that the proportion
of labour to cartage will continue the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears, by your answer to a former question, that the
expense of cartage has been much diminished, owing to your
making use of the materials of the old road; will not the
proportionate expense of cartage for future years be increased
in consequence of your no longer having the resource
of breaking up the roads, but being obliged to repair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>them with fresh materials?—In some degree it certainly
would.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what way is the statute labour at present performed
upon these roads?—Upon two of the trusts only, the Royston
road and the Huntingdon road, I have had occasion to
avail myself of any statute labour; the fund upon the other
trusts being more than sufficient to uphold the roads without
having recourse to statute labour. Upon these two trusts
I have derived some small advantage from statute labour.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>Colonel Charles Brown</i>, called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>Are you one of the commissioners of the turnpike road
upon the Cheshunt trust?—I am.</p>

<p class='c007'>How long have you acted?—Several years, eight or ten
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Be kind enough to explain to the Committee any recent
improvements, which have taken place in the management
and repairs of the roads within that trust?—Since the new
method has been adopted by Mr. MᶜAdam, a very evident
advantage has arisen to the roads; they are now extremely
good, and were formerly very indifferent; I therefore attribute
it solely to the present mode adopted by Mr. MᶜAdam
for nothing can be better than the roads are at present.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state to the Committee, whether the improvement
has taken place with an increase or a diminution of the
expense?—I believe at about one-third less; At least I understand
that it was taken at about one-third less.</p>

<p class='c007'>Has there been any increase upon the tolls upon these
roads?—Not since Mr. MᶜAdam has had any thing to do
with them. I have every reason to suppose there will be
a diminution, in consequence of the good state of the roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having heard Mr. MᶜAdam’s evidence, can you give the
Committee any further information with regard to the means
by which these improvements have been effected?—I conceive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>that the mode of Mr. MᶜAdam has been the means of
making the roads so much better, that it is only wonderful
when we see it now, that it has not taken place sooner,
being founded upon the best principle possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state whether these improvements have taken
place by the use of any new materials, or by a better application
of the existing materials?—By the better application
of the existing materials, certainly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you found this improved system attended with any
advantages, in regard to the employment of the poor within
those parishes?—With regard to the parish where I live,
and where my property is situated, I have seen considerable
improvement, since we have had the opportunity of sending
our poor to be employed by Mr. MᶜAdam, who has most
readily employed every one we have sent; and I can state
now, that we have not a man unemployed that I know of.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>Ezekiel Harman</i>, Esquire, called in and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>You are a commissioner of the turnpike road upon the
Cheshunt trust?—I am.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having heard the evidence of the last witness; can you,
upon your own knowledge, confirm the testimony that he
has given with regard to improvement of the roads within
your trust under Mr. MᶜAdam’s inspection, and the advantages
derived therefrom?—I can, certainly. It is a
matter of surprise to me, that so material an alteration
has been already made in the roads, the advantages of
which are obvious to every one travelling the road; and,
as an additional proof, the coachmen who are in the habit
of driving that road have confirmed this statement. I have
witnessed also a similar improvement in the Epsom road,
where the forward state of the improvement shows an
additional proof of the advantages derived from this system.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>
  <h4 class='c011'><i>Thomas Bridgman</i>, Esquire, called in; and Examined.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Are you a commissioner upon the Cheshunt trust?—I
am.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having heard the evidence of the two last witnesses
does your judgment in all respects confirm the testimony
which they have given, in regard to the improvement which
has taken place upon your roads, and the advantages derived
from them?—Most assuredly. I have witnessed
these roads for more than twenty years, in a variety of
forms as a commissioner. I have observed, the failure of
two or three different sets of coachmen and coach concerns
down below, all of whom are now saying, that if
this system continues they shall require a horse less. All
these parties were originally much prejudiced against the
new system.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>John Martin Cripps</i>, Esquire, called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>You are a magistrate of the county of Surrey, and commissioner
of the roads upon the Epsom trust?—I am.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you inform the Committee what was the state of the
roads within your trust, previous to the year 1818?—They
were very bad, having no attention paid to the formation of
the road; having the water, in many places, going over the
road; and great inattention paid to the breaking of the
materials, and to the expense attending the carting of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>At what time did you commence the alteration in the
system of management?—At the latter end of December
1817, when the roads were put under the superintendence
of Mr. MᶜAdam, senior, and when his son commenced the
management.</p>

<p class='c007'>What alterations have since taken place in the state of the
roads?—By a newer formation of the road; the materials
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>being properly broken; and the water carried under the
road by trunks, or drains, with proper gratings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Referring to the particulars of the expenditure given by
Mr. MᶜAdam, jun. in his evidence this day, can you confirm
the accuracy of those accounts?—Yes; and I can explain
that the items for tradesmen’s bills include the wharfing
and repairs of Bridges in each year; I can add, that the
statute labour for 1815, 1816, and 1817, amounting to one
hundred pounds each year, which Mr. MᶜAdam has not
availed himself of in their improvements.</p>

<p class='c007'>Had the system of management pursued by Mr. MᶜAdam
proved the means of giving employment to labourers in the
district, and thereby lessening the poor’s rates?—Very much
so; and they have occasionally employed from twenty to
thirty persons, stout able-bodied men, who otherwise would
have been obliged to have been supported out of the parish
rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you in consequence had any persons who were able
to work who have been out of employ?—Between twenty
and thirty persons have been employed for the last three
months in breaking flints, and in repairing and improving
the roads, who otherwise must have come upon the poor’s
rates; and all the persons who have been enabled to work
have found employment in consequence of this improvement;
that has been the means of greatly relieving our
poor’s rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Has the same system been extended to the private roads
in that district?—It has been adopted in some of the private
roads of that district, and with the same beneficial effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you state any particulars with regard to the necessity
there has been for carting additional materials for these
roads?—At present Mr. MᶜAdam having lifted the roads,
has found more than sufficient material for the support of
those roads.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>What have been the materials that have been used?—The
materials that have been used are flints chiefly.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the state of improvement of these roads, have the
tolls been increased or reduced within your trust?—At our
last meeting, we agreed, that at the next letting, the tolls
should be reduced from May next, for the benefit of agriculture
in general; and that where two shillings and eight-pence
is now paid, they will have now to pay one shilling;
that with relation to the agricultural interest, will be a reduction
of twenty five pounds per mile.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within your own personal observation, have you known
any other instance in which a road has been formed upon the
same principles as those adopted by Mr. MᶜAdam?—I had
an opportunity of observing in Sweden that the roads were
more beautiful than any I ever beheld; they are formed in
the same manner as by Mr. MᶜAdam, the materials broken
extremely small. The material is the best in the world, as
it is rocks of Granite; and so well do they understand the
necessity of breaking them small, that you never behold
throughout Sweden, a fragment of granite larger than the
size of a walnut, for the purposes of the roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is the shape of these roads?—To the eye they
appear perfectly flat; but upon trial by the spirit level, there
is a slight degree of convexity.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>William Dowdeswell</i>, Esquire, called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>You are a commissioner upon the Epsom trust?—I
am.</p>

<p class='c007'>How long have you been a commissioner?—About four or
five years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you had any opportunity of observing the comparative
state of the roads since they were put under the care
of Mr. MᶜAdam, compared with that in which they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>before?—They were very bad when first put under Mr.
MᶜAdam’s care; they are now, I think, very good.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you attribute this to the improved system of management?—Totally.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you confirm the evidence that has been already given
relative to the expenses of repairing the roads previously
to that time and since?—From the statement made to me
by the former surveyor, and from Mr. MᶜAdam’s statement,
I believe the statements delivered in to you are perfectly
correct. Considering the advantage which the public has
derived from Mr. MᶜAdam’s system, I have adopted the
same upon the parish roads. I offered myself to the parish
as their surveyor, for the purpose of carrying that system
into execution. I have found employment for all persons
who wanted employment upon the parish roads, assisted
occasionally by persons going to the public roads under
Mr. MᶜAdam.</p>

<p class='c007'>How long have you adopted this system upon the private
roads?—Ever since October last.</p>

<p class='c007'>From that period the whole of the poor have been employed
upon the parish roads?—From that period the whole
of the poor that wanted employment, have been employed
upon the parish roads, or upon the public roads under Mr.
MᶜAdam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have those persons been employed by you, by piece-work
or by day-work?—The roads were in such a state, and
as I wanted knowledge to employ by piece-work, I have
been compelled to employ them by day-work.</p>

<p class='c007'>From your experience are you of opinion that these
private roads, made upon the new system which has been
adopted, can be kept in good repair at a less expense
than they formerly cost in their bad state?—At a very
considerable less expense than formerly.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>Mr. <i>Benjamin Farey</i>, called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>You are, I believe, the surveyor of the Whitechapel
road?—I am.</p>

<p class='c007'>How long have you been in that office?—Nine years.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what situation did you find the road, at the time of your
undertaking the management?—I found the Whitechapel
road in a dreadful state, partly from the neglect of the surveyor,
in laying on foul and improper materials. In the
autumn of 1809, it was almost impassable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gravel is the only material you have in that neighbourhood?—Gravel
is the only material we find, on or near the
spot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is the traffic upon the Whitechapel road so great as to
render it impossible to preserve it in good order with the
present materials?—It is impossible to preserve it in good
order at all times, with the present materials; it is past the
art of man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider the traffic upon that road, as greater
than upon any other road out of London?—I believe it is a
heavier traffic; there are not so many light carriages, as on
some other roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>What species of carriages do you consider do the most
injury to your road?—The carriages that do the most injury,
are those with the widest wheels.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what way do you consider that they injure the road?—By
their great weights destroying the materials.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are the carriages you allude to, exempt from the payment
of tolls?—They pay much less tolls. The pressure, or
crushing of materials by the wide wheels, is owing to the
wheels not running flat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being of a conical shape?—Being of a barrelled and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>conical shape, and the middle tire projecting above the
others, with rough nails.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider, that if those wheels were made of a
cylindrical or flat shape, it would be good policy to grant
them any exemption from tolls?—They would be less injurious
for being cylindrical; but whenever the road was
at all out of the level, and the weight came on one edge
of the wheel, the road would be destroyed there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the whole, is it your opinion that there are any
circumstances which justify an exemption from toll, on
account of the breadth of the wheels?—I do not see any
at all, for I think they are injurious in every sense, on
account of the great weights they carry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider that injury is done to the roads, in
consequence of the use of single shafts in waggons?—Very
great.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what way?—In consequence of single shafts, the
horses follow in one track, in the centre of the carriage;
and the wheels also follow each other in other tracks, and
cut ruts: if there were double shafts, they would naturally
avoid former wheel-tracks, which would be less injurious
to the road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider it therefore desirable to give encouragement
to double shafts?—I do.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider the watering of that road in any way
injurious?—I consider that watering that road in summer,
is very injurious.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what respect?—The water separates the stones, owing
to the softening of the loam, and makes the road spongy
and loose.</p>

<p class='c007'>At what periods do you consider it injurious to water
the road for laying the dust?—Before May and after August.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you not a practice of sometimes watering in winter,
when there is no dust?—After the most careful sifting of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>gravel, a small quantity of loamy dirt will unavoidably still
adhere to the stones, and this loam, together with a glutinous
matter which accumulates in the summer from the
dung and urine of the cattle (which accumulation the summer
watering has a tendency to increase) occasions the
wheels to stick to the materials, in certain states of the
road, in spring and autumn, when it is between wet and dry,
particularly in heavy foggy weather, and after a frost; by
which sticking of the wheels, the Whitechapel road is often,
in a short time, dreadfully torn and loosened up; and it is
for remedying this evil, that I have, for more than eight
years past, occasionally watered the road in winter. As
soon as the sticking and tearing up of the materials is observed
to have commenced, several water-carts are employed
upon these parts of the road, to wet the loamy and
glutinous matters so much, that they will no longer adhere
to the tire of the wheels, and to allow the wheels and feet of
the horses to force down and again fasten the gravel stones;
the traffic, in the course of four to twenty-four hours after
watering, forms such a sludge on the surface, as can be
easily raked off by wooden scrapers, which is performed as
quickly as possible; after which the road is hard and smooth,
the advantages of this practice of occasional winter watering
have been great; and it might, I am of opinion, be adopted
with like advantages on the other entrances into London, or
wherever else the traffic is great, and the gravel stones are
at times observed to be torn up by the sticking of the
wheels.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what state of the road are you in the habit of laying
on fresh materials?—I prefer laying on materials immediately
after the road has had a scraping, in consequence of
there being upon the surface of the road a small quantity of
dirty matter and broken gravel, which then form a sort of
cement for the gravel to fix in.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>You consider it advantageous to lay on the materials when
the road is wet?—I do, because the gravel adheres closer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Considering the very great traffic upon the Whitechapel
road, is it your opinion that it would be advantageous to pave
any part of that road?—I think it would be desirable to pave
it, within some feet of the footpath more particularly.</p>

<p class='c007'>What breadth from the sides of that road would you consider
it desirable to have paved?—About eleven or twelve
feet from the footpath.</p>

<p class='c007'>You would consider it a desirable plan to pave the sides of
that road in preference to the centre?—Certainly.</p>

<p class='c007'>For what reasons?—If the centre was paved, the light
carriages would be very much annoyed; when the gravel
road was good on the sides, the heavy carriages would go
there, and the light carriages would be driven on the stones
from the sides again; if the centre was paved the carters
would be obliged to walk on that road to manage their
horses, and would be considerably annoyed by carriages,
horsemen, &amp;c. passing: but if the sides of that road were
paved, the carters would be enabled to walk on the footpath
and to manage their horses without annoyance.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is the shape of road which, from your experience,
you would give the preference to?—I would have the road
barrelled, and made so as that it would convey off the water
in the severe weather in winter, when the roads are generally
bad.</p>

<p class='c007'>Which do you give the preference to, a road with a flat
surface, or one that gradually declines from the centre?—I
think a road which gradually declines from the centre is
by far the most preferable, decidedly so.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is the degree of the declivity or fall which you
would recommend as the most desirable?—I have paid particular
attention to the Whitechapel road, where it is of the
width of 55 feet, and the fall from the centre to the sides is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>12 inches; but to attain this shape, when the road is worn
down, when first covered with gravel, there should be a fall
not exceeding from 16 to 18 inches from the centre to the
sides. [<i>The witness delivered in a cross section of the road.</i>]</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it your opinion that any parliamentary regulation with
regard to stage coaches is necessary for preventing injury to
the road?—None.</p>

<p class='c007'>You think it desirable that they should remain as at
present?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is the state of the Whitechapel road now, as compared
with what it was some years ago?—During the greater
part of the year, it is now one of the most pleasant roads
out of London to travel upon; but from the gravel being
small and brittle, it is soon worn down, by the great number
of heavy weights passing on it. With the small gravel
we have in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel, the road at
times breaks up, and becomes in a bad state; but by the
application of water, to stop the sticking of the wheels, and
separate the sludge, in two days they are found in a good
state again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you any other suggestion to make to the Committee
for the improvement of that road, or of roads in general?—On
that road, very great improvement might be made, in
not allowing the wide wheels to pass by paying so little toll,
or to carry so great weights as at present; if the narrow-wheeled
waggons were to use double shafts, they would be
less injurious to the roads: even with narrow-wheeled carts,
if the two fore-horses were double, the shafts not being in
their track, it would be less injurious to the roads.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>John Farey</i>, Esquire, called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>What is your profession?—I am a mineral surveyor and
engineer.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Have you turned your attention to the state of the roads
in the different districts of the kingdom?—I have, very
particularly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you furnish the Committee with any information with
regard to the state of those roads, as compared with former
years?—I can; I have particularly attended to that subject;
more especially in the time of the late duke of Bedford, for
whom I was an agent. I have since been employed in nearly
every part of England and Wales, and also in Scotland:
and I have statements by me of the various observations I
have made.</p>

<p class='c007'>You have been employed under the late duke of Bedford,
in the improvement of the roads in the neighbourhood of
Woburn?—In the management of his roads in Bedfordshire,
and of all his rural works.</p>

<p class='c007'>Describe what improvement of the main road has taken
place under your direction, in Woburn?—The whole of the
line of the road through Woburn, except about three hundred
yards in different places, is on a very strong alluvial
clay: the road passes over naked sand, only for three hundred
yards; this road had been rendered so sandy and so
bad, entirely by bringing soft sand-stone out of Buckinghamshire,
at three miles carriage, upon the average, in
Woburn, and some of that stone was brought almost to the
end of Hockliff Town, where the best gravel abounds. It
appeared, from the remains of a number of gravel pits,
that there had been formerly a great deal of gravel dug in
Woburn; this circumstance I mentioned to the duke of
Bedford, and he desired search to be made; and it was ascertained
that Woburn might furnish gravel enough, adequate
to any purpose. In consequence of which, his Grace
directed, when the labourers were much in want of employment,
that the poor persons should be employed in preparing
a great quantity of gravel for the purposes of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>turnpike road. I undertook to direct the taking of this
gravel out, and to level the siftings and dirt in a uniform
manner, and lay all the soil again upon the top; by which
means the land was in no degree injured, but, in fact, considerably
benefited, by being loosened to that depth. A
great many hundreds of cubic yards of clean-sifted and
picked gravel were prepared in numerous square stacks, and
the trustees at a meeting, or else their clerk, were informed,
that this gravel his Grace offered to the road at the mere
cost of labour, without any thing for the gravel, or the
temporary damage to the occupiers of the land. After a
long time of hesitation, the trustees or their clerk returned
an answer, that they did not like that mode, alleging that
their surveyor ought to be allowed to dig materials where
and how he liked, and they would not have this gravel: it
lay there, some of it for two or three years, upon the land.
In that time a number of private roads were making of his
Grace’s, and a good deal of it was used on these. The
main road became progressively worse and worse, and the
post-office caused the parish to be indicted. I was then
surveyor, and made an application to the trustees, stating
the circumstances the road was under: that road-trust is
thirteen miles in length, two of which, or rather more, are
in the parish of Woburn; there is a toll-gate in the parish
which the inhabitants are liable to all the toll of; some of
them, even in going and returning to and from their fields:
the trustees had exacted very strictly <i>the half</i> of the statute
duty, although the parish had, I think, eleven miles of
private roads to maintain. I mention this circumstance to
show there was no default on the part of the parish; and it
was afterwards proved, that they had done their duty; the
trustees merely laughed at the application, and said, that
they had nothing to do with it: we must repair the road,
and till we did so, they would not lay out a farthing upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>our road. It happened, very fortunately for the parish of
Woburn, that their act was very nearly out, and they applied
for a new one; the parish opposed it, stating, that the trustees
had misapplied the tolls, and praying, that the part of
the road, through Woburn, should be taken out of their
management; the act accordingly directed, that two-thirteenths
of the tolls should be paid over to the parish surveyors
of Woburn, and the trustees were not to call for any
statute duty, or interfere in the management of this part of
the road; in consequence of this, the gravel mentioned,
which remained, and great quantities dug on purpose, was
used upon the road, in a sufficient quantity at once, so as
to admit of its settling down together; for it wanted lining
nine inches thick, or more, and the road has since been perfectly
good.</p>

<h3 class='c003'><i>Jovis, 25º die Martii, 1819.</i></h3>

<h4 class='c011'><i>John Farey</i>, Esquire, called in; and Examined,</h4>

<p class='c012'>In effecting the improvement of the Woburn road, did
you make use of any particular mode of applying the gravel?—The
gravel, before the time of using it, had been very
clean-sifted, and separated from the dirt and sand; the great
stones had been picked out, and such of the flints which
were of a long and irregular shape, in order that they might
be broken. After laying the gravel upon the road men were
daily employed to rake the gravel into the ruts, and, at the
same time, to carefully pick off the surface any stones that
were either soft or improperly shaped, like long flints, or too
large.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is your opinion, in regard to the form the most preferable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>for turnpike roads?—A small convexity in the
middle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Will you state the fall, in any given width of road, that
you would prefer?—Referring to my brother, Mr. Benjamin
Farey’s evidence, I agree with him in wishing that the section
which he produced, might be received by the Committee,
as an answer to this question.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is there any particular circumstance, in the formation of
roads, more particularly applicable to the immediate neighbourhood
of London?—In the neighbourhood of London,
and of several other large towns, the materials that are to
be readily procured, are of too tender and brittle a nature
to endure the wear of the heavy carriages; I therefore am
of opinion, that it would be proper to pave the sides of all
the principal entrances into London; but not the middle, as
has been done on the Commercial road and Borough Stones’-end
road. My reasons for preferring the sides being paved
are, that it is next to impossible to compel the carters to
keep upon the pavement in the middle of the road, in too
many instances; the fear of damage, from the swift going
carriages, occasions them, either to draw their carts close to
the sides, and walk upon the footpaths, or what is worse to
leave their horses in the middle, beyond a train of carriages.
The sides being paved, would enable one of those trains of
carriages to enter London on one side of the road, and go
out of it on the other, without many occasions to turn out
of their tracks: which keeping nearly to the same tracks,
upon a well-paved road, would not be prejudicial; but on a
road formed of gravel is entirely ruinous.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider that the plan of rolling the roads in the
neighbourhood, of London, might be advantageously introduced?—The
centre of the roads I should recommend to
remain covered with clean-sifted and picked gravel, having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>as many as possible of its large, roundish and smooth stones
broken by means of a hammer before the time of laying it on
the road, and that an heavy iron roller, of from four to five
feet diameter, and not less, might be advantageously used in
the first settling down of this gravel; a small roller, such as
I believe to have been tried in the neighbourhood of London,
very heavily loaded on its top, might have a tendency to
force the loose gravel before it so as not easily to be drawn
or to mount on to the gravel driven before it without crushing
the flints. I will add, I am of opinion, that a roller could
not be beneficially used upon a road at any other times but
after new coating it with gravel, or after a frost or the
sticking of materials to the wheels may have loosened up the
materials.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider that the present regulations in regard to
exemptions of tolls to waggons with broad wheels, are justified
by sound policy?—In my opinion, those exemptions
have wholly originated in mistaken principles, and that no
wheels wider than about six inches are now, in fact, used
upon the roads, owing to the general and gross deceptions
which the waggoners practise as to the breadth of surface
that their wheels roll on; and that if by any more efficient
regulations, the users of broad wheels were compelled to roll
the breadths of surface, which the laws contemplate, all such
wheels would be immediately disused, from the great additional
force of draught which broad wheels occasion during
the average state of all the roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you of opinion that any regulation by statute, for substituting
cylindrical for conical wheels, would remedy that
evil, or justify an exemption from toll?—As far as I have
observed, there are no conical wheels in use: all the wheels
are rounding or barrelled, and it is comparatively an immaterial
circumstance whether they approach the form of a cone
or a cylinder, while they remain so rounding or barrelled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>because their enormous loads roll on a very small portion of
the surface of all those broad wheels. I think that six-inch
cylindrical wheels, or under, are the most practicable and
useful, provided the projecting nails are most rigidly prohibited,
which I believe can never be done but by a penalty
per nail upon the wheelers who put in those nails, and
upon the drivers of the carriages who used such roughly-nailed
wheels.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you of opinion that the penalties now fixed by law
upon over-weights are regulated upon good principles?—I
consider the whole system as to penalties upon over-weights
generally bad; the present regulations seem to me framed
upon mistaken principles, and are the source of very great
impositions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what manner might the penalties and tolls upon carts
and waggons be best fixed?—It is not practicable very simply
or in this way to state any one scale that would be generally
applicable for each breadth of wheels: below six
inches, there should be a rate fixed, which would apply to
ordinary or gate-tolls, and at the weighing machines additional
tolls, which I will call machine-tolls, should be levied
upon all carriages which exceeded the weight, to be regulated
in an increasing scale for each breadth of wheel, so as
very greatly to discourage, but not ruinously to prohibit the
occasional carrying of large weights upon any wheels.</p>

<p class='c007'>You are not, then, of opinion that it would be right to do
away the regulations altogether in respect to the weights,
and apportion the tolls only to the number of horses?—By
no means.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you acquainted with any particular weighing machine,
which obviates the common objection in regard to impositions
by the machine-keepers?—I am; Mr. Salmon, of Woburn,
many years ago, contrived, and had a patent (which
has expired) for a weighing machine, intended to prevent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>impositions on the carters: the machine being so contrived
as to be locked up from the machine-keeper, and accessible
only to the surveyor, and so as to exhibit the exact weight by
a revolving index, like the hands of a clock, which are called
clock-face indexes; a great number of these weighing machines
have long been in use in the kingdom, some in the immediate
environs of London: by looking at the index of which machine,
the carter, or any passer by, may see that the machine,
before the carriage is drawn upon its weigh-bridge, is
in just balance; and all the time the carriage remains upon
the weigh-bridge, the index exhibits the weight, so that the
carter can take it down; and at the same time the dial-plate
is made an abstract of the law, by there being written against
each of the weights fixed, the breadth of the carriage wheel,
and the season to which that weight is applicable at the commencement
of penalties for over-weights.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can you inform the Committee of the expense of a machine
of this description?—I cannot; but it is trifling, compared
with its advantages, and an index may be added to a
machine upon the common principle, using weights, placed
in a scale; they may be applied to any good machine already
in use.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you of opinion there exists any necessity for limiting
the number of horses in carts and wagons, upon roads
where there are weighing-machines?—I am of opinion not;
and even doubt the propriety of calculating the gate-toll by
the number of horses which draw the carriage. Upon private
or parish roads, where no machines are erected, there
seems, however, no other mode of regulating or preventing
excessive loads being carried, to the ruin of the roads, than
limiting the number of horses; but in case of the practice
becoming general, which already prevails in many of the
towns in the middle of England, of there being a weighing-machine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>kept by a cottager, at all the principal entrances at
the town, at which he is authorized (by the local magistrates,
I believe,) to collect a small toll for each weighing, for those
who voluntarily apply to him, by which means all loads
passing into and out of such towns, may be, and the greater
part of them are now, weighed; and if this were adopted in
the environs of London, (with the addition of a yard and
a warehouse, where a carter who has inadvertently taken up
too large a load, either of dung, furniture, or other articles,
of the weights of which he could not be accurately informed,
may learn the same; and where, upon the result of this
weighing, if it should be discovered that he had much too
large a load, he could there throw off and deposit a part of
it, either to abandon it if of small value like dung, or to
take it up from the warehouse, at a future time,) these entrance
weighing-machines would remove the only valid objection
to weighing the loads of manure going out of London,
by which the roads are at present more cut up and destroyed,
than by any other description of carriages.</p>

<p class='c007'>Will you have the goodness to state the principle upon
which you prefer that the tolls should be regulated entirely
by weights and breadth of wheels, without regard to the
number of horses drawing?—Because nothing can be more
vague or unsatisfactory, than the latter mode of defining
weights, or preventing the carrying of excessive loads,
because horses are of such very different degrees of size,
condition and strength, and the humanity or otherwise of
their drivers are so very different; but more on account of
the very great inequality of the different roads of the kingdom,
which this general regulation is now made to apply to,
as to the number and steepness of the hills: the precautions
that have been used, of setting up posts upon the tops and
bottoms of those steeps, to define where extra horses may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>be used, are entirely become useless, comparatively, none of
the hills now remain, to any length, with so great a degree
of steepness, as to cause it to be worth any one’s while to
keep horses stationed there, for the purpose of assisting
heavy carriages up those hills for hire; still less has it occurred
that any waggoner has spare horses following his
waggon, for which he must pay tolls, in order to avail himself
of this useless permission, to use any number of horses
up the steep hills.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you of opinion that stage-coaches require, or would
admit of any regulation with respect to their wheels or
weights?—I am clearly of opinion, that they would not; for
in travelling, when it has happened that I could not get a
seat on the front of the coach, I have, through many long
days, carefully attended to the impression made by the
wheels of the carriages upon which I have been travelling
(when they have been among the heaviest loaded coaches)
and have compared these impressions with those of the carts
and waggons, particularly broad-wheeled ones, which we
met; from which observations, and other more particular
ones, I am of opinion, that the injury done to the roads by
the coaches, compared with their utility and the tolls they
pay, is not such as to justify any legal restraint on their
wheels or weights.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you of opinion, that it would be attended with any
advantage to the roads, to encourage, by any regulation or
exemption from tolls, the use of carriages, varying the length
of their axles, so as to prevent their running in the same
tracks?—I am of opinion it would be very beneficial, and
have particularly so stated to the Board of Agriculture, with
an example of the tolls over a new road, which are so regulated
in Derbyshire: in addition to which, some inducement
in the abatement of tolls, might be made to those carriages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>which now generally use single shafts like the farmers’ carts
and waggons, on their adopting double shafts, so that all
their horses may draw in pairs; this being applicable even to
three-horse carts, as far as concerns the two foremost.
Stage-coaches, for the reasons here alluded to, as they do
all draw in pairs, and very seldom follow in any previous
and deep rut, do far less damage to the roads than otherwise
would happen; their springs also, and swiftness of motion,
contributing, very materially, to lessening their wear of the
road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you of opinion that any advantage would be derived
from the general commutation of statute duty?—I have long
been of opinion that the whole principle of statute duty, as
now regulated, is erroneous; labour in kind should entirely
cease: and the surveyor collect a more equable rate on all
property in his township; the present regulations for calling
out the teams and making of a road rate, are so complicated,
as to be above the capacity of the majority of parish surveyors,
who in most or all instances collect the rates for the
turnpike roads as well as the private roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Will you state your opinion of the statute labour, as it
particularly applies to turnpike roads?—In all the local road
acts which I have examined, one half of the statute duty of
each township is apportioned to each toll road which passes
through any part or corner of that township, which in innumerable
instances, is very highly prejudicial; a due proportion
of the fair road rate, as already mentioned, should be
payable to each toll road, where there are more than one in
the township, in proportion (or nearly so, as the quarter
sessions might order) to all the lengths of all the roads
within the township which it contributes to repair.</p>

<p class='c007'>From your observation of the different roads throughout
the kingdom, do you think that important advantages would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>be derived from their being placed under skilful surveyors,
acting for large districts?—At present, the separate trusts
are so exceedingly different in extent, many of them extending
only three, four and five miles, while others have fifty or
a hundred miles of road under their trusts, that it seems
impracticable, in many trusts, to employ a very skilful and
competent surveyor, on account of the great and unnecessary
expense that would be incurred on the short lengths of road;
but if the legislature should see it right to enact the
appointment of thoroughly competent district surveyors, who
might have the superintendence and control, to a defined
extent, over the officers of the local trustees of turnpike
roads, as well as over the surveyors of the parish roads within
their districts, the most important advantages would result.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you not think great inconvenience arises from the great
numbers generally found forming commissioners of turnpike
trusts?—From my own experience, I cannot say that I have
seen any evil from the great number of trustees, on the contrary,
the greatest mismanagement that I have seen in any
roads, has arisen from the clergymen of the districts being
almost the only acting trustees; the greatest and most active
land owners frequently having no share in such trusts: the
late duke of Bedford, for instance, not being a trustee in the
vicinity of Woburn for many years after he took an active
part in improving the district.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>James Walker</i>, Esq. called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>You are a civil engineer?—I am.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of your experience have you turned your
attention to the making and repairing of roads?—I have
been employed in the making and repairing of several roads,
and the regulation of others.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>In what part of the kingdom have you been employed,
and what observations have occurred to you upon this subject?—The
whole of the works executed under the Commercial
Road, the East India Road, the Barking Road,
and the Tilbury Road Acts, have been under my direction,
as well as the roads made under the Bridge and Dock Companies,
for which I have been engineer. The Commercial
Road, which is between the West India Docks and London
is referred to in the report of a former Committee on highways,
as particularly well fitted for heavy traffic; that road
is seventy feet wide, and is divided into two footways, each
ten feet, and a carriage road fifty feet wide, of which
twenty feet in the middle is paved with granite. I have
a section of the form of this road (No. 1, in the annexed
plan.) The East India Dock branch of the Commercial
Road is also seventy feet wide, ten feet of which
is paved with granite. I have prepared also a section
of that road (No. 2, in the plan.) The traffic upon the
Commercial Road, both up and down, is very great, and
necessarily required a width of paving sufficient for two
carriages to pass upon it. I am quite sure that the
expense of this road would have been very much greater,
probably much more than doubled if it had not been paved,
and that the carriage of goods would also here been much
more expensive; indeed it would have been next to impossible
to have carried the present loads upon a gravelled road.
The road has been paved for about sixteen years, and the
expense of supporting it has been small, although the stage-coaches
generally, as well as almost all the carts and waggons,
go upon it; while the expense of the gravelled part
has been comparatively great. During the thirteen years
that the East India Dock branch has been paved, the paving
has not cost 20<i>l.</i> in repairs, although the waggons, each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>weighing about five tons, with the whole of the East India
produce, which is brought from the docks by land, have
passed all that time in one track upon it, and a great deal of
heavy country traffic for the last eight years, when a communication
was formed with the county of Essex. The
advantage of paving part of a road where the traffic is
great, and the materials of making roads bad or expensive,
is not confined to improving the conveyance for heavy goods
and reducing the horses’ labour; but as the paving is always
preferred for heavy carriages, the sides of a road are left
for light carriages, and are kept in much better repair than
otherwise they could possibly be. It is not, I am sure,
overstating the advantage of the paving, but rather otherwise,
to say, that taking the year through, two horses will
do more work, with the same labour to themselves, upon
a paved road than three upon a good gravelled road, if the
traffic upon the gravelled road is at all considerable, and if
the effect of this, in point of expense, is brought into
figures, the saving of the expense of carriage will be found
to be very great when compared with the cost of the paving.
If the annual tonnage upon the Commercial Road is taken
at 250,000 tons, and at the rate of only 3<i>s.</i> per ton from the
Docks, it could not upon a gravelled road be done under
4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> say however 4<i>s.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> per ton difference, making a
saving of 12,500<i>l.</i>, or nearly the whole expense of the
paving in one year. I think I am under the mark in all
these figures, and I am convinced therefore that the introduction
of paving would, in many cases, be productive of
great advantage, by improving the gravel road, reducing
the expense of repairs, and causing a saving of horses’
labour much beyond what there is, I believe, any idea of.
The expense of a ton of Aberdeen granite paving-stones laid
in London, or in any similar situation, including laying, and
every expense, is about 25<i>s.</i>; the cost of the same weight of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>gravel is from 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> The cost of granite paving,
9 inches deep, is from 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per superficial
yard, or from 750<i>l.</i> to 920<i>l.</i> per mile for every yard in width.
Guernsey granite is harder and more durable than Aberdeen
granite, but is more expensive by about 10 per cent. and
I think is this much better. Some stone of very good
quality from near Greenock, has been used lately upon the
Commercial Road, it is cheaper than Aberdeen, and appears
to be very durable. The requisites for forming a good
paving are to have the stones properly squared and shaped,
not as wedges, but nearly as rectangular prisms; to sort
them into classes according to their sizes, so as to prevent
unequal sinking, which is always the effect of stones, or
rows of stones, of unequal sizes being mixed together; to
have a foundation properly consolidated before the road is
begun to be paved, and to have the stones laid with a close
joint, the courses being kept at right angles from the direction
of the sides, and in perfectly straight lines, the joints
carefully broken, that is, so that the joint between two
stones in any one course shall not be in a line with, or opposite
to a joint in any of the two courses adjoining. After
the stones are laid they are to be well rammed, and such of
the stones as appear to ram loose, should be taken out and
replaced by others; after this the joints are to be filled with
fine gravel, and if it can be done conveniently, the stability
of the work will be increased by well watering at night the
part that has been done during the day, and ramming it over
again next morning. The surface of the pavement is then
to be covered with an inch or so of fine gravel, that the
joints may be always kept full, and that the wheels may not
come in contact with the stones while they are at all loose in
their places. Attention to these points will very much increase
both the smoothness and durability of the paving.
I have found great advantage from filling up, or, as it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>called, grouting the joints with lime-water, which finds its
way into the gravel between and under the stones, and
forms the whole into a solid concreted mass. The purpose
served by the lime might also be effectually answered
by mixing a little of the borings or chippings of iron, or
small scraps of iron hoop, with the gravel used in filling up
the joints of the paving. The water would very soon create,
an oxide of iron, and form the gravel into a species of rock.
I have seen a piece of rusty hoop taken from under water,
to which the gravel had so connected itself, for four or five
inches round the hoop, as not to be separated without a
smart blow of a hammer. And the cast-iron pipes which are
laid in moist gravel soon exhibit the same tendency.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has occurred to me, as I stated to the chairman of this
honourable Committee some weeks since, that considerable
improvement would be found from paving the sides of a road,
upon which the heavy traffic is great, in both directions, and
leaving the middle for light carriages, the carmen walking
upon the footpaths or sides of the road, would then be close
to their horses, without interrupting, or being in danger of
accidents from light carriages, which is the case when they
are driving upon the middle of the road; and the unpaved
part being in the middle or highest part of the road, would
be more easily kept in good repair. I have prepared a section
of a road formed in this way (No. 3 in the plan), but
unless the heavy traffic in both directions is great, one
width (say ten or twelve feet, if very well paved,) will be
found sufficient; and in this case, I think the paving ought
to be in the middle of the road. The width of many of the
present roads is, besides, such, that ten or twelve feet can
be spared for paving, while twice that width would leave too
little for the gravelled part. Although the first cost of
paving is so great, I do not think that any other plan can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>be adopted to good and so cheap in those places where the
materials got in the neighbourhood are not sufficient for
supporting the roads. A coating of whinstone is, for instance,
more durable than the gravel with which the roads
round London are made and repaired; but much less so
than paving; although the freight and carriage of the whinstone,
and of the paving-stones, which form the principal
items of the expense, are nearly the same. Scotch whinstone,
or the granite rubble (that is, rough chippings of
granite,) could not, I should think, be delivered into barges
in the river, at less than from 14<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> per ton, the
freight alone being from 11<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i>, while the price of
Aberdeen granite, in the same situation, is only from 19<i>s.</i> to
21<i>s.</i> and 22<i>s.</i> Maidstone ragstone in the rubble state, costs
about 7<i>s.</i> per ton: it is a limestone, and much less durable
than the whin. The carriage from the river to the road, of
all these, is of course the same. Flint, again, is so much
less durable than whin, that it will not bear the expense of
carriage (which may be taken at from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> per
ton per mile) from any distance, to make it preferable to the
gravel, or paving, in point of cost, for the roads near
London. A double iron rail-road, to suit the London
waggons, which some have recommended, would cost about
4,500<i>l.</i> per mile, and would be fitted for waggons only of
one precise width, and for waggons or heavy carts only;
while, from the difficulty of crossing it, it would form
rather an obstacle to light carriages. Blocks of Aberdeen
granite, twelve inches wide and fifteen inches deep, laid in
the way of the wheels (as recommended by others,) would
be nearly as expensive; and the eight joints, which would
be formed between the stone and the gravel, by four rows
of stone, would be found extremely troublesome and inconvenient.
Both these substitutes for paving, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>though equally expensive as paving, have peculiar disadvantages;
and they have this besides, which is common to
them both, that they make no provision for preventing the
great wear upon gravelled roads, which is caused by the
horses’ feet, particularly if (as is the case in a rail-road) they
are confined in one track.</p>

<p class='c007'>Attention in the forming and repairing of roads, will in
all cases do much to compensate for the inferiority of the
material used for that purpose, of which the improvements
in the general state of the highways within the last twenty
years affords the best proof. To form the road upon a good
foundation, and to keep the surface clear of water after it is
formed, are the two most essential points towards having the
best roads possible, upon a given country, and with given
materials. For obtaining the first of these objects, it is essential
that the line for the road be taken so that the foundation
can be kept dry either by avoiding low ground by
raising the surface of the road above the level of the ground
on each side of it, or by drawing off the water by means of
side drains. The other object, viz. that of clearing the
road of water, is best secured by selecting a course for the
road which is not horizontally level, so that the surface of
the road may in its longitudinal section, form in some degree
an inclined plane; and when this cannot be obtained, owing
to the extreme flatness of the country, an artificial inclination
may generally be made. When a road is so formed,
every wheel-track that is made, being in the line of the inclination,
becomes a channel for carrying off the water, much
more effectually than can be done by a curvature in the cross
section or rise in the middle of the road, without the danger,
or other disadvantages which necessarily attend the rounding
a road much in the middle. I consider a fall of about
one inch and a half in ten feet, to be a minimum in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>case, if it is attainable without a great deal of extra expense.
It is in the knowledge of the above points, and of
the application of them in practice, that what may be called
the science of road-making consists, as the observations
apply in every case. When a road is to be formed, accurate
sections of the rises and falls of the ground should always
be taken, in the same way as is done for a canal, before the
line is determined, or the levels of the road fixed upon, and
when the course and levels of the road are laid down, the
derail of the work ought to be particularly explained by a
specification and plan, describing the manner in which each
particular length is to be formed and completed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quantity of materials necessary to form the road depends
so much upon the soil and the nature of the materials
themselves, that it is impossible to lay down any general
rules for them. The thickness ought to be such that the
greatest weight will not affect more than the surface of the
shell, and it is for this purpose chiefly, that thickness is required,
in order to spread the weight which comes upon a small
part only of the road over a large portion of the foundation.
When the ground is very soft, trees, bavins or bushes, are
applied to answer the same purpose, and to carry off the
water previous to the materials of the road being so consolidated
as to form a solid body, and to be impervious to
water. Bushes are, however, not advisable to be used, unless
they are so low as always to be completely moist. When
they are dry and excluded from the air they decay in a very
few years, and produce a sinking in place of preserving the
road; a thickness of chalk is useful for the same purpose in
cases where bushes are improper, the chalk mixing with the
gravel or stones becomes concreted, and presents a larger
surface to the pressure. If the material for making the
roads is gravel, the common way is to lay it as it comes from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the pit, excepting the upper foot, or 18 inches or so, which
is screened; but if whin or other stone is to be used, the
size of the pieces into which it is broken should decrease as
we approach the surface, the superficial coating not exceeding
a cube from 1 inch to 1½ inch. If the foundation is
bad, breaking the bottom stone into small pieces is expensive
and injurious, upon the principle I have above described,
and also for the same reason that an arch formed
of whole bricks or of deep stones is to be preferred to one
of the same materials broken into smaller pieces, for in
some counties the materials will admit of the foundation of
the road being considered as of the nature of a flat arch, as
well as of being supported by the strata directly under it:
but the error in laying the stone in large pieces upon the
surface is more common and more injurious. In all cases,
whether the material is gravel or hard stone, the interstices
between the pieces should be filled up solid with smaller
pieces, and the finishing made by a thin covering of very
small pieces, or road-sand or rubbish, for those interstices
must be filled up before the road becomes solid, either in this
way or by a portion of the materials of the road being ground
down, which last mode occasions a waste of the material, and
keeps the road unnecessarily heavy and loose. This observation
applies to the repairing as well as the original making of
roads, and the effect of this covering, or as it is called in
the country, blinding the loose stones, is so evident, that
I have often wondered to see so little attention paid to it.
If the material is soft, as some limestone, this is less necessary,
and the quantity ought never to be more than is
just sufficient for the purpose I have described. In the
original making or effectually repairing of a road, it is, I
think, best that the whole of the proposed thickness be laid
on at once, for the sake of the road as well as of the traveller;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the materials of the road then form a more solid
compact mass than when they are laid in thin strata, at different
times, for the same reason that a deep arch of uniform
materials is preferable to a number of separate rings. Though
I state that an inclination in the longitudinal section of the
road is always desirable for the purpose of clearing it of
water, I am not of the opinion of those who recommend the
road to be made and kept flat or level in its cross section.
The variety of opinions and practice upon this point are
very great; both extremes appear to me to be bad. A road
much rounded is dangerous, particularly if the cross section
approaches towards the segment of a circle, the slope in
the case not being uniform, but increasing rapidly from the
nature of the curve, as we depart from the middle or vertical
line. The over rounding of roads is also injurious to
them, by either confining the heavy carriages to one track
in the crown of the road, or if they go upon the sides, by
the great wear they produce, from their constant tendency
to move down the inclined plane, owing to the angle which
the surface of the road and the line of gravity of the load
form with each other, and as this tendency is perpendicular
to the line of draught, the labour of the horse and the
wear of the carriage wheels, are both much increased
by it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not altogether foreign to the subject to notice here,
the error of forming the inclination of the roadway upon
bridges, in the direction of their length, or across the
river, from a section of a curve for the whole length, rather
than from two lines joined together by a curve, as I have
recommended for the cross section of a road. It is to this
cause that the very heavy pull is owing, which must have
been noticed in just getting upon a bridge, which decreases
as we advance towards the middle of the bridge, and which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>would not have been so much felt, had it been spread regularly
over the whole length (see No. 5, in the plan.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The disadvantages of a flat road again are, that even if it
is supposed to continue so, it is bad in principle, by doing
away the tendency which a road ought to have, in every
direction, to clear itself of water; but as the greatest wear
will always be in the middle of the road, a level or flat road
will very soon be concave; the middle of the road then becomes
the watercourse, and the consequence, if the road
is upon level ground, is, that the water and mud lie
upon it, and injure the foundation and materials; or, if
otherwise, that the stones or materials of the road are
washed bare, and liable to be loosened and thrown up by
the wheels coming into contact with their exposed angular
surfaces. Many of the roads in the country afford examples
of this, particularly after heavy rains, and if the country is
at all hilly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The best form for a road, in order to avoid those evils, is,—in
my opinion, to form it, and to keep it with just a sufficient
rise towards the middle, to incline the water towards
the sides; and in place of making the whole width the section
of one curve, to form it by two straight lines, forming
inclined planes, and joined by a curve towards the middle.
I have prepared a section of a road in the manner I have
described (No. 4.) and as the lines, excepting at the centre,
are straight, the section may be made to suit almost any
greater or less width, by merely extending them. The
section is taken nearly from a part of a road made under my
direction in the country. The dotted line drawn upon it
shows the form I alluded to when speaking of the circular
road that ought to be avoided. I have seen ridges formed
in what I thought well formed land, much after what I
would recommend for the form of a road. The object of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>forming the land into ridges, raised a little in the middle, is
the same as that of raising the middle of a road to prevent
the water from settling upon it, and what is sufficient for the
ploughed land is certainly enough for a road. If the road
is of good stone, four to five inches rise in ten feet is sufficient,
gravel, and other inferior material, will allow a little
more. In this section it may be worth while to notice the
situation of the hedge and ditch, or rill on each side of the
road, a more common, but I think a more dangerous and
worse way, is to form the ditch close to the road, and to
plant the quick upon a raised bank beyond it. I have
dotted this mode also upon the section. The advantage of
having the hedge next the road, consists in its greater safety
to the traveller, particularly if a ditch of any considerable
depth is necessary, and in the hedge being supported in its
growth from the ground under the road, without drawing
upon the farmer’s side of the ditch; and it is I believe, this
last advantage, which has led the author of an article in
the Edinburgh Farmer’s Magazine, with whom I am acquainted,
to make nearly the same observations. In a length
of road, made eight or ten years since, over a marsh,
partly a bog, considerably under high water, where, from
the level of the ground, and of the drainage, the ditches
were obliged to be deep and wide, and therefore dangerous;
I ordered some cuttings of willow to be stuck into the roadside
of the ditch. In about two years they formed a blind
to the ditch, and are now so thick and strong as to be a
complete security from all danger. I may here take the
liberty to say, that nothing is more injurious to roads than
the permitting high hedges and plantations near them, their
effect in keeping the rain suspended and dripping upon the
road longer than otherwise it would, and in preventing the
air and sun from drying the roads, is most destructive and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>very general: and as the Commissioners or principal men of
the district are often the greatest offenders in this respect,
the evil is one in which both the enactments and the application
of them require the strictest attention and impartiality.
After a road is properly made, the comfort of the traveller
and the principle of economy on the part of the road-trust,
both demand that it be not allowed to get much out of
repair; the adage of “a stitch in time,” applies particularly
to the repairing of roads, and though not universally practised,
is so well known, that it is, I presume, unnecessary
to state reasons, for what no one acquainted with the subject
at all doubts. The best season for repairing roads is, I
think, the spring or very early in the summer, when the
weather is likely neither to be very wet nor dry, for both of
these extremes prevent the materials from consolidating,
and therefore cause a waste of them, and at the same time,
either a heavy or a dusty road; but if done at the time I
have recommended, the roads are left in good state for the
summer, and become consolidated and hard to resist the
work of the ensuing winter.</p>

<p class='c007'>When I remarked the great improvement in many of the
highways during the last twenty years, I by no means meant
to say that they are not still capable of much greater, or
that many of them have not been much neglected. In many
districts this is notoriously the case, and when the materials
are the best, the roads are frequently the worst. There is
no road round London upon which there is more heavy
country traffic, than the first stage of the great Essex or
Mile End road; and owing to the well directed attention of
the chairman of the commissioners, and of their surveyor,
there are few better roads any where, excepting in very wet
heavy weather. Indeed I do not think it possible to do
much, if any thing, in improving the superintendance and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>repair of that road, with the material at present in use;
for the nature of which, as well as for the exclusion of air
and sun by buildings, proper allowance ought to be made
in judging of the state of the roads near London, and when
this is done, and the great wear considered, we may find that
in very many cases, there is but little cause to find fault,
and much room for commendation. The traffic upon the
Mile End road is however too much for a gravelled road,
and the expanse for repair for the first three miles is consequently
very great. The same remarks as to conduct and
attention, are merited by the commissioners of other districts,
and their gratuitous services entitle them to the
thanks of the public; while in some parts of the kingdom,
including Scotland, where the material is the very best, the
roads are often in the worst condition, and the most unpleasant
to travel upon. The stone is put in large pieces
upon the road, without any covering or mixture of smaller
material, and is left to take the chance of being broke and
formed into a solid, or of tumbling loose upon the road.
When a track is once formed in this stone-heap, it is not to
be expected that the horses will be easily made to move out
of it; and unless the thoroughfare is considerable, the road
in use consists sometimes for a long period, of the two deep
wheel tracks, which are always filled with water during the
winter, and of the horse’s path between them, the other
parts being covered with a body of loose stones, and rendered
absolutely useless. These observations apply to some
lengths of the most frequented highways, but are more particularly
applicable to the cross roads and the parish roads.
I had the opportunity of seeing the roads in the West
Highlands last autumn; they are formed with judgement,
and kept in good repair.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the highways in a county are under the management
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>of trustees, it is common to divide them, and to assign
a particular length to the trustees who live near it, without
employing any person in the capacity of a surveyor. When
this is the case, the state of repair depends much upon the
observation and attention of the trustee; and the change in
the state of the road often marks out the change of superintendence.
A relative of mine has given up a good deal
of his time and attention to a part of the roads in Stirlingshire,
of which he is one of the trustees: no professional
man could, perhaps, do the business better; and the effect
of this attention is very visible. Instances of the same kind
are frequent, but it is not to be expected that trustees
generally can both understand, and have so great a relish
for serving the public, as that the detail of the repairs of
roads, if imposed upon them, will be always executed with
the attention they require.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case of parish roads is still worse, where the inhabitants
are, without much regard to their habits of life,
obliged in their turns to serve the annual office of surveyor
of the highways. If such persons mean to signalize themselves
during their being in office, the first step is often to undo
what their predecessor has done, or has not perfected; and
the love of self and of friends determines them to make
sure while they have it in their power, that some favoured
roads or lanes are put into proper order. If the surveyor is,
on the contrary, an unwilling officer, or if the attention to
his own affairs prevents him giving his time to the duties of
the office, he avoids the fine by accepting the charge, pays
the bills and wages without much knowledge of their nature
or accuracy, and one of the labourers becomes, in fact, the
road-surveyor; but in every case of annual nominations
there is this evil, that so soon as the surveyor has, by a
year’s apprenticeship, begun to know something of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>nature of the business, his place is filled by another, who
comes in for the same time to take lessons at the expense of
the parish. Thus, while many simple trades require, by
law, an apprenticeship of seven years, before the person is
thought qualified to practise with his own capital, the road-surveyor
is supposed fit, the very hour he is named, for an
office which requires at least as much understanding and
experience as the average of trades, and in which he has
the capital of all the parish to speculate with. For these
reasons, I have always been convinced of the propriety of
an intelligent accountable officer in each district, but I do
not see to whom he can be responsible with so great propriety,
or in other words, in whom the chief control can be
so well vested, as in the gentlemen who live in the county,
who are almost daily witnesses of what is doing, and are
chiefly interested in keeping down the expenses, at the same
time having their roads in good repair.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether a board of roads, appointed by parliament, meeting
once every year, and forming a report of the expense and
state of the roads in each county, to be presented to parliament,
with such observations as present themselves, as to improvements,
or otherwise, taken from general surveys made
by persons appointed by them, would be useful, by exciting a
spirit of emulation and attention on the part of the different
trusts, every member of this honourable Committee is as
able, and perhaps more able, to give a disinterested judgment
than I am; for I conclude, that if surveys are to be
made, engineers will think they have some chance of being
selected as the most proper persons to be employed on the
occasion, under the board. The state of the roads continue
to improve throughout the kingdom. Every friend to his
country will be pleased, if the march of this improvement
can be accelerated by a moderate reform, and carried into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>remote corners and parishes, where it appears most to be
wanted; but I much question the propriety of such a revolution
as would lessen the interest, which, in their present
situation, the commissioners ought to feel in the repair of
their roads, and the consequence which the appointment
tends to give them.</p>

<p class='c007'>If country road-surveyors are appointed throughout the
kingdom, the nomination might be with the commissioners
of the county, and if friendship or local interest is supposed
to operate too far, the nomination, or the examination previous
to election, or the <i>veto</i> after it, might be with the
central or other board, the members of which might be supposed
not to be connected with the individual, in the same
way as pilots and the masters of men of war are examined by
the elder brethren of the Trinity House. And sub-surveyors
or surveyors of parishes, might in the same manner be appointed,
or undergo an examination by the county commissioners
and county surveyor, to qualify them to be elected;
for it is to be lamented, that in cases where parishes have,
from the reasons I have mentioned, made the office of road-surveyors
permanent, with a salary: the election being
popular, has fallen, not upon the candidate who was really
the best qualified, but probably upon some honest decayed
tradesman, who, having proved himself unable to manage
his own business, which he ought to have known the best,
has thereby, and by his long residence, qualified himself for
managing a public business, of which he probably knows
nothing, but whether he does, or does not, rarely enters
into the consideration of the majority of the voters.</p>

<p class='c006'>In what manner do you think the extra toll for overweight
ought to be regulated; whether by the weight, or
by the number of horses used, without regard to the weight?—I
think by the weight most certainly; unless the object is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>to discourage the breed of small horses, and encourage the
over-loading and straining, of horses of all sizes. The
number of horses is a very imperfect measure, or rather no
measure at all of the injury done to the roads; for a load
of three tons, drawn by one horse, injures the road as
much, to say the least of it, as if two horses were used.
It is not out of place to mention the extreme disproportion
between the penalties for overweight, and the injuries which
they are meant to compensate for, or to prevent; particularly
when this over-loading is the effect of ignorance,
which is almost always the case. When the tolls are in the
hands of trustees, the penalty is almost always reduced; a
proof that that fixed by law is exorbitant; but when the
tolls are farmed, and the trustees do not reserve the power
of mitigating the penalty, the poor carman has less chance
of being saved perhaps from ruin.</p>

<h3 class='c003'><i>Jovis, 1º die Aprilis, 1819.</i></h3>

<h4 class='c011'>Mr. <i>James Dean</i>, called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>What is your profession?—I am a land agent and civil
engineer, and am occasionally employed to solicit bills in
parliament as an agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where do you reside?—I reside in London about half the
year, and the other half in Devonshire.</p>

<p class='c007'>As an engineer, have you had the means of becoming
acquainted with the roads of the kingdom?—About twenty
years since, I had the appointment of surveyor to the trustees
of the turnpike roads from Oxford to Henley upon
Thames, and from Dorchester to Abingdon, in Berkshire;
since then I have been employed about several roads in
Devonshire and Cornwall, and, latterly, in surveying and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>reporting on an extensive district of the roads in Somersetshire.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the observations which you have made in this employment,
are you able to give the Committee any information
as to the best mode of improving the roads of the
kingdom generally?—The first and most obvious improvement
is to shorten distances; but even that must be governed
by circumstances often of a local nature; a sound foundation,
and the contiguity of good stone or gravel to a road,
should not be overlooked in choosing a new line, or departing
from an old one. In forming a new line in a level
country, the transverse section should approach as near as
possible to the form of the accompanying sketch No. 1, and
in a hilly country to that of No. 2; in the former, the water
from one half the road would be carried into a ditch on the
field side, and that of the other half into a ditch between
the footpath and hedge-bank. When it is necessary to form
a road on the side of a hill, the ditch should be on the
higher side of the road, where it will receive the water
falling from the high ground, and so keep the foundation of
the road dry. I have figured the breadths of a good average
turnpike road on sketch No. 1, but the breadth will
frequently depend upon circumstances of a local nature.
Near to great towns, it would be highly advantageous if the
centre of the road, for about twelve feet in width, were to
be paved with hard well-squared stones, nine inches deep,
and the sides made with hard rubble stones or gravel. I
need scarcely mention, that in applying the materials to a
new line of road, the stones should be broken into pieces of
an uniform size, as near as may be; that the larger should be
laid of nearly an equal depth over the whole surface of the
road, and the smaller, mixed with gravel, should be placed
upon them. The repairing of roads should be conducted
in the same manner as far as it is practicable; but, after all,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the only sure way of getting good roads is, for the trustees
to employ men of education and science as their surveyors.
In a few instances, where this has been done, the best
consequences have resulted, and in no case is if more
conspicuous than in the neighbourhood of Bristol, where
Mr. MᶜAdam is the surveyor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Will not a consequent impediment arise to the employment
of men of education and of superior ability as surveyors,
from the smallness of the funds upon small trusts or
districts?—For that reason, I would recommend the consolidation
of the several trusts, in each county, into one
general trust, under the authority of one general act of
parliament, leaving the adoption, however, of the acts to
the discretion of the several trusts respectively in each
county, making it compulsory only on the minority, at the
expiration of a time to be limited, when a majority in
amount of toll shall call for its adoption, and after insertion
in the provincial papers and London Gazette.</p>

<p class='c007'>Supposing parliament to adopt your suggestion as to the
passing of such an act, and supposing that afterwards the
trusts of none of the counties should adopt it as a general
trust, would there be any objection to the act being so
framed as to admit of adoption by such of the trusts as
might prefer it to incurring the expense of a renewal of
their then local acts?—I do not think there would be any
well founded objection to an act made capable of being so
applied; and I am of opinion, that the making it optional
on trustees to adopt it or not, would render the measure extremely
popular, and in the end be highly beneficial to the
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you not lately prepared a bill for the trustees of an
extensive trust in Somersetshire, including in it nearly all
the improvements which you would recommend to be introduced
into a general turnpike act?—I have prepared such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>bill; and it was intended that the same should have been
brought before parliament in the present session, but the
clerk to the trustees having omitted to put the notice required
by the standing orders of parliament upon the sessions-house
door, at the Michaelmas sessions, the trustees resolved
to defer presenting their petition until the next session.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what respect does the bill which you have prepared
differ from the generality of local turnpike acts?—Many of
the clauses of the bill are not so remarkable for originality,
as their combination is calculated to produce extensive benefit
to the country, by conferring larger powers than have
heretofore been given to any one body of trustees; among
others, it empowers the trustees to appoint committees, and
make bye-laws; it binds them to provide a fund for buying
up outstanding securities; and to pay off the further sums
proposed to be raised under the new act, within the term of
the act; the tolls on wheel carriages are made referrible to
the breadth of the fellies, and description of wheel, and to
the weight drawn, rather than to the number of horses,
drawing, and are founded on a statement which I had the
honour of delivering to a Committee of the House of Commons
in 1809. The standing orders of parliament require
that on or before the 30th of September next, preceding
any application to parliament for any Turnpike Act, a plan
&amp;c. of the roads proposed to be made or altered, shall be
deposited with the clerk of the peace. It often happens,
that in the Committee alterations are made in the proposed
line, when the plan deposited becomes mere waste paper;
the seventy sixth clause of this bill provides for the depositing
of a plan, &amp;c. last determined upon, with the clerk
of the peace, signed by the Speaker, and being an authentic
document can be referred to with safety. The bill also provides
for the making of commodious footpaths by the sides
of the roads. And as the paving, cleansing, lighting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>watching, &amp;c. of the liberty or borough of&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* is
placed in the trustees of the roads, the trustees are empowered
to rate the inhabitants, and are also empowered to
light the streets, &amp;c. with gas, and to allow gas to be taken
from their mains for the lighting of private dwellings, manufactories,
&amp;c.; so that in all probability the latter indulgence
may pay the greater part, if not the whole, of the expense
of lighting the public lamps. The ninety-third clause empowers
the trustees to pave, light and watch any town, village
or place through, which the roads pass, upon application
of two-thirds of the inhabitants, and is in my view extremely
important.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you any further suggestions to offer to the Committee
that would tend to the improvement of the roads, or
the laws relating to them?—Upon the subject of turnpike
roads, and of wheel-carriages generally, I am of opinion
that such a spirit of improvement has gone forth as, with
the assistance of judicious legislative enactments, will in a
few years carry both to a state of very great perfection;
but I cannot close these remarks without observing on the
injurious effect which the large fees paid to the higher
officers of both houses of parliament has upon the growing
improvements of the country, by preventing a recurrence to
parliament to remove obstacles which the prejudice of some
will not, and the incapacity of others cannot permit. The periodical
expenses of renewing turnpike acts is really enormous,
when it is considered that between the fees of parliament
on the one hand, and a two month’s residence in London of
the country solicitor, to manage the business, besides a parliamentary
agent in town to assist him, four or five hundred
pounds are soon swallowed up; but I also feel it right to
suggest, that if parliament would allow affidavits to be made
before two magistrates in the county, of the notices directed
by the standing orders of parliament, having been duly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>given, of plans and of books of reference being lodged
with the clerk of the peace, and of the names of the persons
assenting to, dissenting from, or being neuter in respect
of any proposed new road, the solicitor need not remain in
town more than three days, and the expenses, except in
cases of opposition, need not exceed 200<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Would you, as a parliamentary agent, undertake to prepare
and conduct an ordinary road bill through parliament
for 200<i>l.</i>, to include all expenses, where there is no opposition?—I
would undertake any number at that sum, provided
the proofs before mentioned were admitted to be made
by affidavit in the county, in like manner as the proofs are
now given to facilitate the passing of inclosure bills.</p>

<h3 class='c003'><i>Jovis, 6º die Maii, 1819.</i></h3>

<h4 class='c011'><i>Thomas Telford</i>, Esquire, called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>You are, I believe, a civil engineer?</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, I am.</p>

<p class='c007'>The roads which have been formed by direction of the
Parliamentary Commissioners for the Holyhead road, and
under your management, having been described to this
Committee as being very perfect, will you have the goodness
to state your opinion as to the present condition of the
different turnpike roads of the kingdom, and what improvements
you would recommend in their direction and management.
In the first place, state to the Committee in what
respect you consider the roads of the kingdom at present
to be defective, either in their formation or management?—</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the roads in England and Wales, they
are in general very defective, both as to their direction and
inclinations, they are frequently carried over hills, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>might be avoided by passing along the adjacent valleys; at
present the inclinations are inconveniently steep, and long
continued. I might instance many principal lines, over which
I have had frequent occasion to travel: I shall select the great
road from Holyhead, through North Wales to Shrewsbury;
and from thence by Birmingham and Coventry to London.
On the Welsh portion of it, those parts which have been improved
under the direction of the Parliamentary Commissioners
for the Holyhead road, the inclinations were formerly
(in many instances) as much as one in six, seven, eight,
nine, and ten, the width at the same time frequently not exceeding
twelve feet, without protection on the lower side,
and the roadway itself of improper construction. The improvements
which have lately been made in North Wales,
I beg leave to submit as models for roads through hilly
countries, although these improvements have been made
through the most difficult and precipitous district of that
country, the longitudinal inclinations are in general less
than one in thirty; in one instance, for a considerable distance,
there was no avoiding one in twenty-two, and in
another, for about two hundred yards, one in seventeen;
but in these two cases, the surface of the roadway being
made peculiarly smooth and hard, no inconvenience is experienced
by wheeled carriages. On flat ground, the
breadth of the roadway is thirty-two feet, where there is
side cutting not exceeding three feet, the breadth is twenty-eight,
and along any steep ground and precipices, it is
twenty-two, all clear within the fences; the sides are protected
by stone walls, breast and retaining walls and parapets;
great pains have been bestowed on the cross drains,
also the draining the ground, and likewise in constructing
firm and substantial foundations for the metalled part of the
roadway. From Shrewsbury upwards, the road at present is
encumbered with many hills, all of which might be avoided,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>or much improved. There is a very long one between
Shrewsbury and Heygate, several between that point and
Shiffnal, two between Shiffnal and Wolverhampton, one
between Wolverhampton and Birmingham, viz. at Wednesbury,
&amp;c. Maiden Hill, between Birmingham and Coventry;
Braunston Hill, between Dunchurch and Daventry; a continued
succession of hills between Daventry and Towcester;
afterwards the well-known Brickhill and Hockliffe hills,
besides the very circuitous and imperfect road between
South Mims and Barnet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another instance I would beg leave to mention to the
Committee, is the road between the towns of Shrewsbury
and Worcester, on the way to Bath, which consists of nearly
a succession of very high and inconveniently steep hills,
although very easy inclinations might be obtained by passing
along the side of the river Severn.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have mentioned these two instances as examples of the
present imperfections of main roads, and it is quite evident
they might all be readily avoided by lines of new road,
easily to be accomplished. These, I presume, the Committee
will admit are sufficient to show the present state of
many other roads in the kingdom, they not having been
selected as more particularly defective than others.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shape, or cross sections and drainage of the roads,
are quite as defective as the general direction and inclinations;
there has been no attention paid to constructing a
good and solid foundation for the roadway; the materials,
whether of gravel or stones, have seldom been sufficiently
selected and arranged; and they lie so promiscuously upon
the road as to render it inconvenient to travel upon, and
promote its speedy destruction. The shape of the road, or
cross section of the surface, is frequently hollow in the
middle; the sides encumbered with great banks of mud,
which have accumulated sometimes to the height of six,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>seven and eight feet; these prevent the water from falling
into the side-drains; they also throw a considerable shade
upon the road itself, and are gross and unpardonable nuisances.
The materials, instead of being cleansed of the
mud and soil with which they are mixed in their native state,
are laid promiscuously upon the road; this, in the first instance,
creates an unnecessary expense of carriage to the
road, and afterwards nearly as much in removing it, besides
inconvenience and obstruction to travelling; the materials
should therefore be cleansed on the spot where they are
procured, from every particle of earth, by screening, or if
necessary, even by washing; some additional expense
might in the first instance be incurred by these operations,
but it would be found by much the most economical and
advantageous mode in the end. In all cases, materials in
their native state are composed of particles and pieces of
different sizes, it is most important that those should be
separated, and that the largest size should be reduced to
not more than six or eight ounces in weight, and laid in the
bottom part of the road; those that are under that weight
or size may be laid on the top or surface of the road; the
surface itself should be made with a very gentle curve in its
cross section, just sufficient to permit the water to pass from
the centre towards the sides of the road, the declivity may
increase towards the sides, and the general section form a
very flat ellipsis, so that the side, at the time, should (upon
a road of about thirty feet in width) be nine inches below
the surface in the middle. Connected with the cross section
are the side drains which are to receive the water, and
which drains, in every instance, I particularly recommend
to be on the field side of the fence, with apertures in that
fence for the water to pass from the sides of the road into
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fences themselves on each side form a very material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>and important subject, with regard to the perfection of roads;
they should in no instance be more than five feet in height
above the centre of the road, and all trees which stand
within twenty yards from the centre of it ought to be removed.
I am sure that twenty per cent. of the expense of
improving and repairing roads is incurred by the improper
state of the fences and trees along the sides of it, on the
sunny side more particularly; this must be evident to any
person who will notice the state of a road which is much
shaded by high fences and trees, compared to the other parts
of the road which are exposed to the sun and air. My observations,
with regard to fences and trees, apply when the
road is on the same level as the adjacent fields; but in many
cases, on the most frequented roads of England, more stuff
has been removed from time to time than was put on; the
surface of the road is consequently sunk into a trough or
channel from three to six feet below the surface of the
fields on each side; here all attempts at drainage, or even
common repairs, seem to be quite out of the question; and
by much the most judicious and economical mode will be to
remove the whole road into the field which is on the sunny
side of it. In cases where a road is made upon ground where
there are many springs, it is absolutely necessary to make a
number of under and cross drains to collect the water and
conduct it into the aforesaid side-drains, which I have recommended
to be made on the field side of the fences.</p>

<p class='c007'>In constructing the bottom part of a road, (which would,
of course, be made of an elliptical form) if it is upon clay,
or other elastic substance, which would retain water, I
would recommend to cover the whole bottom of the road
with vegetable soil, in cases where the natural shape of the
ground admits; I would not remove the original surface, and
where there are inequalities I would fill them up with vegetable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>soil, so as to cut off all connexion with clay. Where
gravel is the material to complete the road with, I have
already mentioned, that it ought to be completely cleansed
of every particle of clay or earthy substance, and its different
sizes ought to be selected and arranged by means of riddling
or washing; in the use of the riddle, the particles of earth
or clay adhere so much to the stones that it frequently requires
to be exposed to the sun, air, and frost, for several
months, and then riddled over again. In this gravel, the
stones are of different sizes and different shapes; all those
that are round ought to be broken with a small hammer, and
in mentioning hammers, I beg leave to draw the attention
of the Committee to their weight, shape and manner of
using, which is of much more importance than any one can
conceive who has not had much experience in road-making;
the difference in managing this operation being not less than
ten per cent. and is, besides, of equal importance towards
the perfection of the road; the size and weight of the hammer
I would apportion to the size and weight of the stones,
and the stones should be broken upon the heap, not on the
ground; it must be evident that using round stones will be
the means of deranging the position of those near them,
and of grinding them to pieces.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you of opinion that the gravel which is found in the
pits in the neighbourhood of London is calculated for making
roads capable of bearing the heavy weights which the great
traffic round London occasions to be used upon them?—I
am of opinion that the materials in the whole valley or
plain around London being entirely silicious, or flints, and
easily ground, to dust, are very improper. This must be
evident to every person who travels near London in any
direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you of opinion that it would be advisable or practicable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>to procure from any particular part of the country, either
by canal, or by river conveyance, better materials, so as to
form perfect roads, without the necessity of paving them?—That
those materials could be procured both by the canals;
and by sea is evident; but I am satisfied that the most
economical and preferable mode would be by means of
paving.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you consider that it would be advisable to pave the
whole of the roads, or that the paving of the centre or
sides, as has been recommended by some witnesses, would
be sufficient?—I apprehend that the paving a proper width
in the centre would be quite sufficient, gravel might be
proper enough for the sides, upon the same principle that
we, in all new roads which are constructed, make use of
metalling, or broken stones on the middle part of the road,
for about from sixteen to eighteen or twenty feet in breadth,
and leave the sides gravelled and kept dry; this, in general,
forms a very perfect road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is there any principle which you would think proper to
recommend in regard to the shape of the stones to be used
in paving roads?—I am of opinion that the general shape of
the stones at present used for paving, and the modes of distributing
them are very imperfect, the lower part of the
stones being of a triangular wedge-like shape, which, instead
of enabling them to resist the weights which come upon
them; easily penetrate into the substratum; the stones are also
broken of an unequal size. The remedies for these defects
are obvious, they should be as nearly as possible of a cubical
form, its lower bed having an equal surface with its upper
face; they should be selected as nearly as possible of an
equal size, and they should never be of great length on the
face.</p>

<p class='c007'>In quarrying and preparing the stones would there be any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>additional expense in forming them into the cubical shape now
recommended?—There would certainly be an additional
expense in the preparation, because there would be more
work required in the dressing, and many stones must be
rejected which are now used; but I think the additional
expense would be very well bestowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you of opinion that great injury is done to turnpike
roads by the heavy weights carried in waggons upon them?—I
am.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are you of opinion that any breadth of wheels for those
waggons will justify the present exemption from tolls?—It
certainly ought not.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what manner would you recommend that the tolls
should be apportioned to the weights carried by waggons on
those roads?—I am of opinion that the most advisable mode
would be to apportion the tolls to the weight carried on each
wheel, without reference to the breadth, provided it is not
allowed to be less than four inches.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the purpose of assessing the tolls in this instance
would it not be necessary that the waggon should be weighed
at every turnpike gate?—There ought to be a power to do
it, but there might be a check by means of toll tickets,
similar to what is done upon navigable canals.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a view of establishing good roads generally throughout
the kingdom, and of keeping them in repair upon the
most economical plan, what limitation would you propose
as to the actual weight each carriage should be allowed to
carry?—I should think it should never exceed four tons,
which should be a ton upon each wheel; when it exceeds
that weight the best materials which can be procured for
road-making must be deranged and ground to pieces.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>REPORT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>THE SELECT COMMITTEE appointed to take into consideration
the Petition of Mr. <span class='sc'>MᶜAdam</span>, and to report to
the House, whether any and what further pecuniary Grant
shall be made to him, either by way of payment of his
Expenses or as a remuneration for his Services, for having
introduced into practice an improved System of constructing
and repairing the <span class='sc'>Public Roads</span> of the Kingdom, or
for the management of the Funds applicable to the same;—<span class='sc'>Have</span>,
pursuant to the Order of the House, examined
the matters to them referred, and have agreed upon the
following REPORT:</p>

<p class='c007'>In presenting to the House the result of their
inquiry into the claim preferred by Mr. MᶜAdam
for a compensation for his services, in consequence
of his having devised and introduced
into practice an improved and economical system
of repairing, making and managing the
Turnpike Roads of the Kingdom; your Committee
will notice, in the first place, the proceedings
which have taken place upon this subject
previous to the institution of the inquiry in
which they have been engaged.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>It appears from the correspondence and documents
obtained from the Treasury, as well as
from the Reports of former Committees of the
House, appointed to inquire into the state of the
Highways of the Kingdom, that the first application
made by Mr. MᶜAdam for payment of
his expenses, and remuneration for his services,
was in November 1819. This application was
referred by the Lords Commissioners of His
Majesty’s Treasury, by letter, to the Postmasters
General, for explanation and information; who,
in reply, transmitted a Report from Mr. Johnson,
the Superintendent of Mailcoaches, stating
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“As I travel rapidly over great distances, and
my attention is usually much occupied with
the immediate business of the office, I cannot
speak with accuracy about particular and local
alterations; but I feel myself well warranted
in stating, that whenever I have found any
thing done under Mr. MᶜAdam’s immediate
direction, or by his pupils, or even in imitation
of his plan and principles, the improvement
has been most decisive, and the superiority
over the common method of repairing roads
most evident; and, as Superintendent of Mailcoaches,
I have abundant reason to wish that
Mr. MᶜAdam’s principles were acted upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>very generally: if they were, a pace which in
winter, or any bad weather, cannot be accomplished
without difficulty, would become perfectly
easy; to say nothing of the comfort and
safety of the traveller, and the credit to humanity
in lessening the labour of the animals.
I may add, although so much has been accomplished,
the Postmasters General could still
expedite the conveyance of the Mails, and
bring the arrangement of the Posts nearer to
perfection, if the Roads were universally as
much improved as the practice of Mr.
MᶜAdam’s plan would effect.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(Signed)      <span class='sc'>Cha. Johnson</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>General Post Office,</i> }</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Dec. 8, 1819.</i>”     }</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“As one instance of the benefit of Mr.
MᶜAdam’s improvement, I beg to mention
that the Mail last winter lost ten, fifteen, and
twenty minutes, in passing from Staines to
Bagshot; but now the time is exactly kept.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(Signed)      C. J.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And the Post Masters General also concluded
their Report to the Treasury by observing,
“That with respect to the road near Staines, to
which he alludes, we had found it necessary
to give notice of indictment, which has been
prevented by the Commissioners resorting to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Mr. MᶜAdam’s assistance and advice, which
has produced the excellent road mentioned by
the Superintendent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Road from Newbury, through Reading,
to Twyford, has been so much improved,
that the Mailcoach has been better enabled to
keep its time than heretofore, and we are convinced
that if the roads near London were
improved in a similar manner, considerable
advantages would be obtained to the correspondence
in general, but particularly in places
from ninety to one hundred miles distant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In February, the Lords Commissioners of His
Majesty’s Treasury received a representation
from several noblemen and gentlemen, urging in
very strong terms the claim of Mr. MᶜAdam to
remuneration for the services he had rendered to
the Public. This document, as well on account
of the grounds upon which the remuneration is
stated to have been merited, as also from its
having been so numerously and respectively
signed, well deserves the attention of the House.
Mr. Harrison, by desire of their Lordships,
transmitted this certificate with a letter to the
Postmasters General; in which, amongst other
observations, and alluding to the recommendation
in favour of Mr. MᶜAdam before mentioned,
he writes as follows:—“These testimonials
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>are of so highly respectable a nature
from the station and character of the individuals
who have signed them, and are so decisive
as to the merit, not only of the system
itself, but also of Mr. MᶜAdam’s personal labours
and exertions in reducing it into practice;
and as to the great advantages which
the Public have already derived therefrom on
several important lines of road in different
parts of the Kingdom, that my Lords could
not hesitate a moment in affording to any application,
which Mr. MᶜAdam may be advised
to make to Parliament for remuneration for
these services, their perfect and entire concurrence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the Postmasters General in the same
letter are directed, after taking into their consideration
these testimonials, together with any
subsequent information they may have acquired,
to report whether the sum of 2,000<i>l.</i> or any
other sum might, in their opinion, be advanced
to Mr. MᶜAdam, to relieve him from the difficulties
under which he then laboured, and until
the pleasure of Parliament shall be obtained;
to which the Postmasters General reply by letter
of 23d February 1820, in still stronger terms of
commendation of the services of Mr. MᶜAdam,
stating that “they consider Mr. MᶜAdam’s system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>of making and repairing roads as deserving
of every encouragement, that its beneficial
results are acknowledged in every part of the
various districts of the country where the
trustees of roads have availed themselves of
his assistance and suggestions, that he has in
the most disinterested manner given every
facility to other persons with the same general
object; and that the observations of their Surveyor
of Mailcoaches, enclosed in their Report
of the 20th December, have acquired additional
force from the experience of the last
two months, in which the mail coaches have
had to contend with unusual difficulties; for
it has been evident on such parts of roads
where Mr. MᶜAdam’s system has been pursued,
the public mails have experienced less
interruption than where the old system was
persisted in; and their Lordships conclude
their letter by recommending the advance of
2000<i>l.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the session of 1819, a Select Committee
was appointed to take into consideration the
Acts in force regarding the Turnpike Roads and
Highways of the Kingdom, and the expediency
of additional regulations for their better repair
and preservation. This Committee reported, in
the most decided terms, as to the success of Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>MᶜAdam’s system. The following is a short
extract from that Report: “The admirable
state of repair into which the roads under Mr.
MᶜAdam’s system were brought attracted very
general attention, and induced the commissioners
of various districts to apply for his assistance
or advice. The general testimony
borne to his complete success wherever he has
been employed, and the proof that his improvements
have been attended with an actual
reduction of expense, while they have afforded
the most useful employment to the poor, induce
your Committee to attach a high degree
of importance to that which he has already
accomplished. The imitations of his plans
are rendered easy by their simplicity, and by
the candour with which he has explained
them, although ability in the surveyor to judge
of their application must be understood as an
essential requisite.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In session 1820, Mr. MᶜAdam presented a
petition to Parliament, praying for the payment
of his expenses, and such reward for his services
as the House in its justice and wisdom
should think fit to grant. This petition was referred
for consideration to the Select Committee
then sitting upon the state of the Highways,
who had the account of Mr. MᶜAdam’s expenses
up to 1814 submitted to them; and from which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>account it appears, that the distance travelled
by Mr. MᶜAdam was 30,000 miles, and that
there were 1,920 days employed in this service;
that reckoning by the rules of allowance made
by the Post Office to their surveyors, the expense
of the above travelling amounted to the
sum of 5,019<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> which sum Mr. MᶜAdam
states to have been expended by him on this
service up to August 1814.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. MᶜAdam further states, in his Evidence
before the Committee; “This account is made
from memoranda in my possession, and I have
made the same with such care and attention,
that I am ready to make oath that it is to the
best of my knowledge and belief correct,
whenever I may be required so to do.”
Which he afterwards did in the following terms:</p>

<p class='c029'>“I, John Loudon MᶜAdam, do hereby voluntarily
make oath that the above-mentioned
account delivered by me to the
Committee on Turnpike Roads and Highways,
is to the best of my knowledge and
belief correct.”</p>

March 1821.</p>

of July 1820, state as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The attention of your Committee has been
directed to the claim of Mr. John Loudon
MᶜAdam for public remuneration, contained
in his petition referred to them by the House.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your Committee apprehend, that the ability,
industry and zeal of Mr. MᶜAdam in his successful
pursuit of the best means for constructing
roads are become matters of general notoriety.
It appears that Mr. MᶜAdam first
directed the public attention to this important
fact, that angular fragments of hard materials,
sufficiently reduced in size, will coalesce or
bind, without other mixture, into a compacted
mass of stone nearly impenetrable to water,
which being laid almost flat, so as to allow of
carriages passing freely upon all parts of the
road, will wear evenly throughout, not exhibiting
the appearance of ruts or of any other
inequalities. This principle, once brought
under notice, may appear sufficiently obvious;
but Mr. MᶜAdam has had the honour at much
expense of labour, of time, and of his private
fortune, to bring it into practice on an extensive
scale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your Committee are therefore clearly of
opinion, that Mr. MᶜAdam is entitled to reward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>and they approve of the advance made
to him by the Postmaster General, under
sanction of the Treasury. Your Committee
have called for the correspondence which
passed upon that occasion. They have examined
Mr. Freeling, Chief Secretary to the
Post Office; Mr. Johnson, Surveyor or Superintendent
of Mailcoaches; and they have received
statements from Mr. MᶜAdam, in support
of his further claim, all of which they
insert in the Appendix; and after a full investigation
of the matters submitted to them,
your Committee are of opinion, that Mr.
MᶜAdam is entitled to further reward for his
services, but they think it much better in all
respects to leave the amount to the Post Office,
than to mention any specific sum themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“While every individual throughout the nation,
and almost every concern is benefited
by good roads, the Post Office derives peculiar
and more direct advantage from them, combined
with constant and accurate intelligence
respecting their state; your Committee, therefore,
consider the Post Office best able to form
a correct opinion upon the subject, and they
moreover feel that a debt is due from the
revenue of the Post Office, to be paid on any
extraordinary occasion to the Roads of Great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Britain, a debt contracted by the exemption,
however properly given, of their carriages
from toll.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On all these grounds your Committee think
it right to refer the Petition of Mr. MᶜAdam
to the Postmasters General, under the sanction
of the Treasury, with their favourable recommendation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And in the Appendix to that Report it will
be found from the Evidence of Mr. Freeling,
“That the Post Office did not take Mr.
MᶜAdam’s services into consideration, or suppose
that 2,000<i>l.</i> would be a sufficient remuneration
for those services; they merely stated,
in answer to papers from the Treasury, that
they considered it would be right to <i>advance</i>
to Mr. MᶜAdam the sum of 2,000<i>l.</i> and consider
Mr. MᶜAdam’s claims as establishing a
ground for further remuneration.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of that Report the Lords
Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury again,
on the 23d of September, refer the subject to
the Postmasters General, who, considering the
first sum of 5,019<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> to be admitted as proved
before the Committee, recommended the payment
of his expenses from 1814, to be calculated
upon the same principle as the travelling allowance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>is made to the Superintendent of the Mailcoaches,
amounting to 1,837<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and they
further propose the sum of 2,000<i>l.</i> or 2,500<i>l.</i> to
be granted to Mr. MᶜAdam, as a moderate compensation
for his services; upon this the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury issued a second
sum of 2,000<i>l.</i> stating that their Lordships, adverting
to the large amount of Mr. MᶜAdam’s
claims, cannot feel themselves justified in issuing
any further sum to him on account thereof, without
the express authority of Parliament for that
purpose. On the 5th December 1820, Mr.
MᶜAdam again addressed a letter to the Lords
of the Treasury, which was transmitted to the
Post Office; and the Postmasters General, referring
to their former letter, observe that they
have no difficulty in bearing their testimony to
the services of Mr. MᶜAdam, and to the benefits
which the Public were likely to derive from
them, and also stated that in their opinions the
charges were reasonable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last Memorial presented by Mr. MᶜAdam
was to the Postmasters General, who, in transmitting
it to the Treasury, observe, “The favourable
opinions which we entertained and
expressed in our former Reports upon this
subject have been confirmed by experience;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and that by employing Mr. MᶜAdam to survey
the roads in Lancashire the most beneficial
results are likely to follow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Having thus given a succinct and connected
account of these different proceedings, and
having taken into their consideration the whole
of the correspondence which has passed previous
to this inquiry between the Lords Commissioners
of His Majesty’s Treasury and the Postmasters
General, together with the several Memorials
presented at different periods to these departments
by the Petitioner, with the documents
accompanying them, and having considered Mr.
MᶜAdam’s statement of his case, and the proof
adduced in support of it, which accompany this
Report, your Committee are of opinion that
Mr. MᶜAdam has, by means of great assiduity,
skill, and many years personal labour, and at a
considerable expense, out of his private property,
introduced into very extensive practice a system
of repairing, making and managing the turnpike
roads and highways of the kingdom, from
which the Public have derived most important
and valuable advantages.</p>

<p class='c007'>That in addition to the notoriety of the fact,
that the improved condition of the public roads
is in a great degree to be ascribed to the ability,
zeal, and indefatigable exertions of Mr. MᶜAdam,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>it now for the first time appears, that Mr.
MᶜAdam has gratuitously given his personal attention
upon, and advice and assistance to, no
less a number than seventy turnpike trusts in
twenty-eight counties of the kingdom, from
many of which he has not received the payment
even of his expenses; that he has, for a considerable
length of time, been engaged in an extensive
correspondence with persons connected
with the management and improvement of
roads, affording, in the most unreserved manner,
information and instruction wherever required;
and that he has attended, during several sessions
of Parliament, the Committee of this House,
for the same purpose of communicating information:
all which services, together with the
assistance he has been called upon to give to the
Post Office, he has rendered without reward or
pecuniary compensation of any kind, beyond
the sum of 4,000<i>l.</i> advanced to him by the
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, in part
payment of his expenses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking to the result of these services as
affecting the community at large; the increase
of comfort, convenience and safety to the Public
generally; the diminution of expense in the
wear and tear of carriages of all descriptions;
the reduction of horse-labour, and consequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>expense of horses; the relief the oppressive burthen
of the poor rates, by the additional means
created for employing the surplus labouring population
of the encumbered parishes; the abolition
in many instances of a great part, and in
some, of the whole of the statute duty complained
of by the agriculturists, and the very
essential benefit to the agricultural, commercial
and manufacturing classes, by the more easy
and equal diffusion of the produce of the soil
over the various parts of the kingdom; the free
as well as rapid circulation of commercial capital,
thereby adding greatly to the national
wealth and prosperity which this system has
materially contributed to effect; the Committee
cannot hesitate to express their opinion, in concurrence
with that already pronounced by the
Heads of the Department of the Post Office,
that the sum of 2,000<i>l.</i> or 2,500<i>l.</i>, in addition to
his expenses, to be calculated after the same
rate of allowance as is granted by that office to
the Surveyor or Superintendent of Mailcoaches,
will be but a moderate compensation to Mr.
MᶜAdam for his great exertions and very valuable
services.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Committee, with a view to abridge the
Appendix, have omitted to include several testimonials
forwarded to them from different innkeepers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>and postmasters, stating the advantages
they have derived from the improvement of the
roads under Mr. MᶜAdam’s system; but which
tend to confirm the general opinion favourable
to the system.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears that Mr. MᶜAdam has held, from
the year 1816 to the present time, and now holds,
the situation of general surveyor of the Bristol
Turnpike Roads at a salary, the first year, of
400<i>l.</i> and each subsequent year, of 500<i>l.</i>; but
taking into consideration, that out of his annual
salary 200<i>l.</i> is for expenses incident to his Office,
the remaining sum of 300<i>l.</i> is, in the opinion of
this Committee, not more than an adequate
payment for the constant and laborious duties
attached to the situation, and cannot, or ought
not, to be considered as constituting any remuneration
to Mr. MᶜAdam for his other distinct
and important services.</p>

<p class='c007'>It further appears, that the three sons of Mr.
MᶜAdam are employed as general surveyors
upon various lines of road in different parts of
the Kingdom; that they have been and are
competitors with all other road surveyors, over
whom they possess no other advantage than
such as their superior intelligence, skill and industry
entitle them to, having no exclusive or
preferable privilege whatever; that they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>improved, and at the same time have very considerably
reduced the expense upon almost all
the roads under their management; and that
their incomes, when diminished by the necessary
disbursements and payments to the persons
acting under them, and their own expenses,
cannot be deemed too large a sum for their own
individual services; but, on the contrary, that
they have returned to the Public for the amount
of their gains a fair and full measure of benefit,
by the personal activity, skill and labour so conspicuous
in the management of the roads, and
the funds of the trusts under their superintendence;
that two of the three had relinquished
situations of profit to afford their aid in giving
effect to and carrying the system into execution,
and are justly entitled to the fruits of their industry,
and hard-earned incomes, without the
participation of any other person; and it does
not appear that the Petitioner has profited in
any manner from the salaries allowed to his
sons.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to the petition of Mr. Wingrove,
referred to your Committee, it appears, from the
Petitioner’s own statement, that his object is a
compensation for services which he considers
himself individually to have rendered to the
public, a claim which your Committee can neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>investigate nor entertain, being foreign to
the object of their inquiry; and no part of Mr.
Wingrove’s statement appearing, in the opinion
of your Committee, to affect the system of Mr.
MᶜAdam, or impeach his claim to a remuneration
for services performed, they feel it necessary
only to present his evidence without further remark.</p>

<p class='c007'>In like manner, and with the same observation,
they may dismiss the petition of Mr. Lester,
between the comparative merit of whose literary
productions with those of Mr. MᶜAdam, and
whether Mr. MᶜAdam has “infringed upon his
literary property,” your Committee are not
called upon to determine; nor is it within their
province to pronounce an opinion upon the degree
of merit belonging to Mr. Lester for the
construction of the various models of machines
exhibited to your Committee, and alleged by
Mr. Lester to be applicable to, and useful for,
the improvement of roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>In conclusion, your Committee desire to state
it as their opinion, that the value of Mr.
MᶜAdam’s system, and consequently of his services,
by no means appears to its full extent
upon the roads under the immediate management
of himself, or of his sons; but that the
effect produced upon a considerable portion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>the roads generally throughout the Kingdom,
since the adoption of his system, has been manifest,
and, as your Committee conceive, too apparent
to escape the most common or indifferent
observer; and further, that it must be obvious,
from past experience, that a system from which
so much good has been already derived, would,
if extended over the whole face of the Kingdom,
be productive of the most beneficial consequences
both to the condition of the roads,
and in effecting a reduction of the amount of
the present enormous and improvident expenditure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee would therefore strongly recommend
to the House the consideration of the
subject of making and managing the roads of
the Kingdom in the course of the ensuing Session
of Parliament, feeling convinced that whatever
plausible appearance the plan may assume
of appointing a large number of noblemen,
gentlemen, farmers, and tradesmen, Commissioners
of Roads, that the practice has everywhere
been found to be at variance with the supposed
efficiency of so large a number of irresponsible
managers; and that the inevitable consequences
of a continuance of this defective system will
be, to involve the different trusts deeper in debt,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and leave the roads without funds to preserve
them in proper order.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee cannot close their Report
without directing the attention of the House to
that part of Mr. James MᶜAdam’s evidence, in
which he states the practicability of converting
the pavement of the streets of London into
smooth and substantial roads; and your Committee
have the satisfaction to inform the House
that the experiment is about to be tried in two
very different and distinct parts of the Metropolis,
viz. in St. James’s Square, and over
Westminster Bridge and its boundary. This
most desirable improvement has, as appears
from the evidence of Mr. MᶜAdam, senior, and
from that of Mr. William MᶜAdam, already
been tried, and completely succeeded (as is well
known to many members of the House) both at
Bristol and Exeter, and is in progress of execution
upon the paved ways in the county of Lancaster.</p>

<p class='c007'>The benefit to the inhabitants of this large
City by such an important improvement, in all
its various advantages of comfort, convenience,
and economy, can scarcely be appreciated; and
your Committee hope that the plan about to be
tried in two separate parts of London will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>found so far to succeed as to induce its adoption,
at least in all the large streets of the Metropolis,
observing, that they believe that it is a plan
which Mr. MᶜAdam has for many years urged
the adoption of, and, as constituting a part of
his system, will be found mentioned in all his
publications on the improved system of road-making.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Mercurii, 28º die Maij, 1823.</i><br /> SIR THOMAS BARING, BART.<br /> In the Chair.</h3>

<h4 class='c031'><i>John Loudon MᶜAdam</i>, Esquire, called in; and Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>You were formerly a magistrate, and commissioner of the
roads in Scotland, were you not?—I was.</p>

<p class='c007'>When did you first turn your attention to road making?—I
was a commissioner and trustee of the roads in Scotland from
the time of my return from America in the year 1783; and I
naturally turned my attention to it there, because they had
begun about twelve years before to make the roads turnpike,
and they were carrying them on with considerable activity when
I returned from America; and it appeared to me at that time,
and all the time I was trustee, that there was a great deal of
money expended needlessly, and with very little effect, on the
roads, and that of course turned my attention to the cause. I
began then to travel through different parts of the country to
inspect the different managements of different parts of the road,
first in Scotland, and then I went into England. In the year
1798, I came to live in England, at Bristol. I have no documents
to prove my travelling before I came to reside in England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>in the year 1798. In 1798 I began to make it a sort of business.
Without saying to any one what my object was, I travelled
all over the country in different parts. I have a list of
such of those places I travelled to that I happened to keep memorandums
of, but I cannot possibly say all the places I travelled
to.</p>

<p class='c007'>How long were you occupied in travelling for the purpose of
obtaining information for the construction of roads?—It was only
occasional travelling of course. I had some other occupations
and private affairs to look into. I began in the year 1798 to
travel as often as I had leisure and convenience down to the
time I took the charge of the Bristol roads, down to the year
1816, the beginning of 1816 or latter end of the year 1815.</p>

<p class='c007'>What was the result of your observations and inquiry of the
state of the roads?—I found the roads were extremely bad in
all parts of Great Britain, as far back as the year 1798, and
that very little improvement took place in them between that
time and the year 1815, which I attributed to the ignorance of
the persons who had the charge of them, the ignorance of the
surveyors, the total want of science.</p>

<p class='c007'>What were the objections which you found?—I found the
materials so applied that the roads were all loose, and carriages,
instead of passing over the roads, ploughed them; that was the
general fault of the roads, and the loose state of the materials,
I apprehend, was owing to the bad selection, the bad appropriation,
and the unskilful laying of them. I came to that conclusion
first, from observing that in some parts of the country
where things were better managed, there were better roads;
and I instanced the roads between Cross and Bridgewater, in
Somersetshire; there I saw a better road than in most other
parts of the country, and having inquired into their management,
I found that they prepared their materials better. The
next improvement that I saw in roads, was at Kendal, in Westmoreland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>where I think the same result proceeded from the
same cause. That led me to the conclusion, that under a better
system of management a better road would be produced; and
having gone to every part of the country, and inquired into the
manner in which they made the roads, I formed a theory in my
own mind. This theory I got leave to put in practice by being
appointed to the care of the Bristol roads, of which I was a
commissioner in January 1816.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did you make any inquiry into the expenditure of money
upon those roads, that you found in so bad a state?—I did.</p>

<p class='c007'>What was the result of that inquiry?—I generally found
that the expense was in proportion to the badness of the roads,
not to their good quality, but as the roads were bad and badly
managed the expense increased, and I found few roads that
were not deeply in debt and in distress for money.</p>

<p class='c007'>In what did the improvident expenditure consist?—I think
principally in carting great quantities of unprepared materials,
and putting them into the roads where they were not wanted;
that was one source of needless expense; and then the materials
being put in so bad a state did not last; the road went
soon to pieces. I believe there was a great deal of other kind
of prodigality, of a worse character than carelessness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did you find a larger quantity of materials put in the road
than was necessary?—I did, in most instances; a much larger
quantity than was necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did you discover, in any of the roads, that there were materials
sufficient, if raised, to make a good road, without putting
on the additional, quantity?—In a very great number, I think
the greater number, I found a sufficient quantity of materials
for giving them one good making, without any further addition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Were these the whole of your observations on the state of
the roads?—No. It is not very easy to explain to gentlemen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>exactly, the particulars that I know to be wrong in roads; I
found the water-ways, and things connected with keeping the
roads dry, exceedingly neglected in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Be so good as to state what defects you observed in the construction
of the roads, besides those you have already mentioned?—I
think the water-ways were extremely neglected, and
the roads in general were covered with water, and many of
them standing in wet. It was a practice formerly to dig a
trench when they made the new road. There was a hollow
way, and a great deal of the bad quality of roads in general
was owing to the circumstance that the road was standing in
water. I think that was one very great error formerly; but the
roads were made upon no principle; there seemed to be no
object; the persons who made them did not seem to understand
there was some object to be gained; they had no other idea of
mending a road than bringing a great quantity of material, and
shooting it on the ground. When a road got into entire disrepair,
the next thing was to bring a quantity of the same kind
of unprepared material, and to shoot it upon the road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did you find that they made use of bad material when a
better was to be procured?—I found that to be very universally
the case, that the tops of the quarries, and that to be easily
procured, was taken in general, and the best stone left behind.
I am afraid that is too much the custom in the country still.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did you find they put these materials on the road in an unprepared
and unfit state?—I did; they were not broken, nor in
many cases cleaned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you any thing further to state with regard to the construction
of the road?—No; I do not recollect any thing further
I can state.</p>

<p class='c007'>What inquiry did you make into the management of the
funds of the different trusts?—I made it a business to inquire
generally of the surveyors, workmen, and people on the roads,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>as to the expense of materials, cartage, day-labour, and then I
took what pains I could with gentlemen of the country, to inquire
into the state of the funds: with surveyors and other
officers of trusts, I found a jealousy and an unwillingness
every where to give me information. An unauthorized individual
finds it extremely difficult to procure information of that
sort, and I found it so; a very great unwillingness to inform.</p>

<p class='c007'>What class of persons did you find in the situation of surveyors
on the road?—Always, I think, almost without exception,
very low people, many of them old servants, ruined
tradesmen, people without that kind of energy and character
which I think is absolutely necessary for such a service.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did you make any inquiry into the mode of the performance
of statute labour?—Yes; I inquired very particularly about
that, and I found the statute labour, when called for, was sent
by the farmer to the roads, but the people seldom did above
half a day’s work; and though the farmer lost the service of
his servants and team, the public did not get it; it was a
heavier oppression on the country than benefit to the roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did you find, in collecting the materials, that there was any
deficiency, or any mismanagement, on the part of those who
superintended it?—I had very great reason to believe, that in
most instances the country was imposed on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you any knowledge of it?—No, I have no knowledge;
I had no legal means of taking such measures as should have
made me so certain as to be able to give evidence to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>What extent of turnpike road is there in England and Wales?—On
my first examination before a Committee of this House,
I stated my opinion to be 25,000 miles; but I see, from a corrected
state of the returns made to parliament, which I made
out, that the number is 24,599 miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you know what sum is annually expended upon these
roads?—The annual income has been ascertained by the same
returns to be 1,282,715<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Can you state what part of the sum goes to the payment of
the interest of the debt, and what is applied to the improvement
of the road?—The mortgage debt in the kingdom is 6,036,502<i>l.</i>;
but there is a large sum due to treasurers, and balances of interest,
which is also bearing interest, amounting to 569,041<i>l.</i>
The whole debt that bears interest is 6,605,543<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>What is the amount of tolls?—1,282,715<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>What do you compute the expense of statute labour at?—I
never have made any guess at it; for two reasons, statute labour
is so difficult to guess at; and the proportion given to the turnpike
roads is so different in different parts of the country, under
local Acts, and under the general Act; but in the roads under
my management it amounts to about five per cent. of the toll-duty.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>Mr. <i>James MᶜAdam</i>, Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>Have you in any instance tried the experiment of converting
paved streets into roads?—I have in several instances taken
up small pieces of pavement that I found upon the several road
trusts, and substituted road. In the town of Stamford I took
a piece up of considerable extent, which is now road instead of
the pavement.</p>

<p class='c007'>What has been the effect of the conversion of the pavement
into road?—The expense has considerably diminished, and
facility of travelling very considerably increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>Has any suggestion been made to you of converting the
pavement of any part of the streets of London into road?—I
have been ordered, by the Parliamentary commissioners having
charge of Westminster Bridge, to prepare an estimate and report,
with a view to convert that pavement into a broken stone
road, which documents I have furnished; and I have reason to
believe that the same will be immediately carried into effect.
I have been also directed by the trustees and proprietors of St.
James’s square, to prepare (which I have done) the same documents,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>with a view to substitute a broken stone road in St.
James’s square, in lieu of the present pavement.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is your opinion of the effect that would be found from
its being carried into execution in all the streets of London, as
to the reduction of expense, and benefit generally to the public?—I
consider that the expense would be most materially reduced;
the convenience of passing over the surface, there could
be no doubt, would be generally facilitated, and made more
convenient, particularly in the great leading streets, such as
Piccadilly, Pall-mall, Parliament street and Whitehall, and
others of that description; the expense of the same weight of
stone now put upon those streets as pavement would be obtained
at infinitely less expense, in a different form, for the
purpose of road-making.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it your plan to raise the present pavement, and convert
that pavement into materials for making the road, or to bring
new materials and dispose of the pavement?—For Westminster Bridge
I recommended to the trustees to sell the present pavement,
because as long as pavements continue to be generally
used, stone in that shape and size will always be valuable, and
the same weight of granite I could obtain for the formation of
the road over the bridge at 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per ton, the present pavement
being worth a guinea per ton; but were the streets of
London generally taken up, pavement would of course become
of less value, and it might be broken for the formation of the
roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is that pavement of a quality calculated to make good roads?—The
best material in the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>What proportion would the pavement now used in the streets
of London bear to the materials necessary to the formation of
the roads?—There would be sufficient for the formation of a
strong durable road in the first instance; and I estimate that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>supply of materials for the future care of the road, for a considerable
time, would be left.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would that answer in all the small streets of the metropolis
as well as for the large and open streets?—I think not so well
in the very narrow streets, which are liable to water, and
where, from the width of the street, the thoroughfare must necessarily
be upon one given spot. I beg, however, to observe,
that the thoroughfare in those streets is extremely small.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would the dust be increased or diminished by this alteration?—I
consider, that upon a well made stone road, with the
same care of cleansing and watering that is given to the streets,
that the annoyance from dust would be infinitely less; and a
road is more susceptible of retaining the water than pavement.</p>

<p class='c007'>What would be the proportion of the annual expense between
the paved street and the road?—Taking seven years,
during which time I calculate that the pavement gets worn
out, I should think the annual expense of the road would not
be one fifth part, because in that seven years the whole value of
the pavement is nearly lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>What would be the effect produced upon the necessity of
raising the road for the purpose of alteration of the pipes and
other works under the street?—At present, when this operation
is necessary, a paviour, whose wages are from five to six shillings
a-day, is required. Were the streets converted into stone
roads, a labourer at eighteen-pence a-day would perform the
same service; and by due care in laying the materials on one
side, and the earth on the other, the injury to the road would
be extremely small, and the spot would very soon become obliterated;
whereas in raising a part of a paved street it is quite
impossible ever to unite the piece so raised with the rest of the
pavement.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Supposing the pavement to be converted into a road, in that
case, would it be necessary, when any pipe was repairing, to
stop up the way to prevent carriages and horses passing?—Certainly
not more so than at present, as that circumstance must
always depend upon the width of the street. In very narrow
streets, where the pipe lies in the centre, a large opening is necessary;
it would follow as a matter of course that the street
must be stopped; but upon large streets one side would be left
free.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would not a repair be more rapidly executed, supposing the
way to be a road instead of a street?—Were the streets converted
into roads, the repair of the roads would be almost unknown
to the public, and no stoppage whatever would take
place; the repair of such roads would be limited to a one-inch
coat at a time, which would scarcely be known to persons passing
in carriages, and the great inconvenience at present constantly
felt in every part of this large metropolis by the necessity
of repaving the streets would cease.</p>

<p class='c007'>You assume that the roads for the streets in London must be
made with granite?—Most assuredly, I should never recommend
any other material to be made use of for the roads in the
town.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>Mr. <i>William MᶜAdam</i>, further Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>Have you, in the course of your practice, converted any
paved street into a road?—Yes, I have; Fore-street Hill, in
Exeter, forms part of that turnpike trust; it is very steep, and
was exceedingly slippery, so much so, that I never rode on
horseback down it myself till it was converted into a stone road;
it has been so for a year or two; it has answered every purpose,
and stood remarkably well, and by being watered a little
in very dry weather, I believe there is less inconvenience found
from dust than when it was paved. I have heard some gentlemen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>say, that in coming up that hill with their carriages, it not
being above a furlong and a half or two furlongs in length,
they have saved from five to ten minutes time since it was made
road; and I have heard coachmen say, that when they brought
their horses quite cool to the bottom of that hill, they have
been quite in a lather by the time they got to the top of it, from
the terror of the horses in slipping about.</p>

<p class='c007'>That was when it was paved?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>What kind of stone do you use for making that road?—The
pebble of the country, picked from the gravel pits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have you converted any other part of Exeter from pavement
into road?—There is no other part of Exeter under the care of
the trust; but in consequence of the effect which the Chamber
of Exeter saw in Fore-street, they have broken up a great
many of the streets in Exeter, and, I believe, are proceeding
gradually to do them all. In the town of Newton-Abbot there
is a county bridge; the county have broken up the bridge
bands, and converted it in a similar manner.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>John Loudon MᶜAdam</i>, Esq. further Examined.</h4>

<p class='c012'>Have you, in any instance, made the alteration stated by
your sons?—Yes, I have; I found the suburbs of Bristol were
entirely paved when I took charge of the roads of the district;
those suburbs are within the jurisdiction of the commissioners
for the care of turnpike roads; and I found the expense of
paving was very heavy, and the effect very bad, and I at once
took the whole pavement up, and broke the stone that I found
there into a stone road, up to the jurisdiction of the magistrates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Was that granite stone?—No, a kind of stone called the
blue pennet in that county, and part of a light stone called
Brandon Hill stone; both tolerably good stones: the blue
pennet is certainly not so good as granite; the Brandon Hill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>stone, when broken, is pretty nearly as good as granite. But
those suburbs having been taken up, and given great satisfaction
the year before last, the magistrates took up half of the
street, called Stoke’s Croft, which is the great entrance of the
town from Gloucestershire. The inhabitants were very much
afraid of dust; and therefore they requested the magistrates not
to take up the whole of the street, but to make an experiment
on one half of it, and after a year’s experiment they consented
to the whole being taken up. When I left Bristol, which is now
three months ago, they were busy taking up the remainder of
that street; and I understood it was the intention of the magistrates
to proceed gradually to take up a great number of other
streets in the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you know what difference it has made in the expense?—That
part of the suburbs that was lifted, and laid again with
the same stone broken, cost 5<i>d.</i> a square yard for doing it. I
took up the stone; I had nothing to purchase; the stone that
came out of the streets fully made the road, and we had a little
remaining for repair afterwards, and that operation cost 5<i>d.</i> a
square yard; paving, in the city of Bristol, cost 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a square
yard when stone is found by the paviour, and I believe they
reckon the laying down to be eighteen-pence of that.</p>

<p class='c007'>What would be the difference of expense annually between &amp;
paved street and a road?—I think that road required no repair
for the first three years after it was done.</p>

<p class='c007'>A paved street would require no repair for seven years after
it was done?—I think we repaired it for about a fifth part of
the money, when it required repair, that a pavement would
have cost. We seldom find our streets in Bristol last above
three years; the pavements become rugged, and full of holes,
and so on; they are obliged to be taken up, and they relay
them generally once in three years. There is another street in
Bristol which has been taken up, but I cannot recollect the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>name of it; it goes from  Stoke’s Croft to Kingston; it has been
taken up by the magistrates, not under my direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Has any objection been taken by any person to the alteration
that has been made at Bristol?—No, except the alarm that the
inhabitants of Stone Croft had when it was begun to be done,
and they got the magistrates to delay doing more than half of
it till they were satisfied that it would not inconvenience them;
and the circumstance of their sending a request to the magistrates
to finish it induces me to believe that they were very
much satisfied with the experiment. Park-street, in Bristol,
has been done in that way for, I think, seventeen years; I was
then a commissioner for watching and paving the streets of
Bristol.</p>

<p class='c007'>Who did it?—It was done at the expense of the commissioners
for watching and paving, at my wish, and I certainly
did superintend it, though I had nothing to do with it more
than any other commissioner had. It is a street many gentlemen
know very well; it is a public road from Bristol to the
Park, and very steep; I believe it is a rise of three inches in a
yard, and when paved was so very dangerous and slippery that
many accidents arose from it, and now it is a very good road
indeed, and I do not believe that it cost upon an average, since
that alteration, more than one fourth of what it used to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>What stone was it paved with before?—Black rock-stone, a
species of limestone.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Appendix</span> (B.)<br /> MEMORANDUM of Mr. Johnson, respecting the Roads under Mr. MᶜAdam’s superintendence.</h3>

<p class='c012'>As I travel rapidly over great distances, and my attention is
usually much occupied with the immediate business of the
office, I cannot speak with accuracy about particular and local
alterations. But I feel myself well warranted in stating, that
whenever I have found any thing done under Mr. MᶜAdam’s
immediate direction, or by his pupils, or even in imitation of
his plan and principles, the improvement has been most decisive,
and the superiority over the common method of repairing
roads, most evident; and, as superintendent of mailcoaches, I
have abundant reason to wish that Mr. MᶜAdam’s principles
were acted upon very generally. If they were, a pace, which
in winter or any bad weather cannot be accomplished without
difficulty, would become perfectly easy, to say nothing of the
comfort and safety of the traveller, and the credit to humanity
in lessening the hard labour of the animals. I may add, that
although so much has been accomplished, the postmaster general
could still expedite the conveyance of the mails, and bring
the arrangements of the posts nearer to perfection, if the roads
were universally as much improved as the practice of Mr.
MᶜAdam’s plan would effect.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>We beg to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Harrison’s letter
of the 26th ult. transmitting, by your lordships command, the
application of John Loudon MᶜAdam, submitting his claim on
account of his inquiries relative to the improvement of the
roads in this kingdom, and requesting any information in our
power with regard to Mr. MᶜAdam’s services.</p>

<p class='c007'>In conformity to your lordship’s desire, we have applied to
the superintendent of mailcoaches, as the officer in our department
most competent to give information upon the subject of
Mr. MᶜAdam’s exertions; and we beg leave to inclose his report,
and to add, that with respect to the road near Staines, to
which he alludes, we had found it necessary to give notice of
indictment, which has been prevented, by the commissioners
resorting to Mr. MᶜAdam’s assistance and advice, which have
produced the excellent road mentioned by the superintendent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The road from Newbury, through Reading to Twyford has
been so much improved, that the mail-coach has been better
enabled to keep its time than heretofore; and we are convinced,
that if the roads near London were improved in a similar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>manner, considerable advantages would be obtained to the correspondence
in general, but particularly in places from ninety
to one hundred miles distant.</p>

<p class='c016'>Certificate and Recommendation by several Peers and
Members of Parliament, to the Right Honourable the
Lord Commissioners of the Treasury, respecting Mr.
MᶜAdam’s Claim for remuneration.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears to the undersigned, by the report of a Committee
of the House of Commons of last session, and by their own experience
and observation, that the system of road making, introduced
by Mr. MᶜAdam, has already been of great public
benefit, as it facilitates the communications of the country, and
affords useful and universal employment to the labouring class,
with sufficient funds already provided.</p>

<p class='c007'>The undersigned are of opinion, that as Mr. MᶜAdam obtained
the information necessary to perfect his system of road
making, entirely at his own expense, and with the labour of
many years; and afterwards, by his exertions and those of his
family, reduced the system to actual practice, and has now put
the public in complete possession of his plans, Mr. MᶜAdam
has a claim on the country for remuneration.</p>

<p class='c007'>They are further of opinion, that it will be a great means of
encouraging the general adoption of this improved system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>road management, if Government shall be pleased to bestow
this mark of their approbation on Mr. MᶜAdam.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
